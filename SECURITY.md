# Security Policy

## Supported versions

RoomScope is a pre-release (0.4.x, see [docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md](docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md)).
Only `main` and the newest 0.4.x version are maintained; no version has been
published outside the private repository yet.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository
(**Security → Report a vulnerability**). Do not open a public issue for a
report that could be abused.

If private reporting is not enabled yet, contact the repository owner through
GitHub. You should hear back within a few days.

## What is not a security issue

Wrong RT60 figures, surprising validity flags, GUI layout bugs and similar
analysis or usability problems are ordinary bugs. Please open a
[measurement](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/measurement.yml) or
[bug](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml) issue and attach the files listed in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Files from other people

Session folders, bundles, `comparison.json`, `project.json`, sweep sidecars
and WAV files are treated as untrusted data. RoomScope never unpickles or
evaluates them, caps JSON size and nesting, is meant to turn malformed content
into a `RoomScopeError` rather than a crash (`tests/robustness/`), and reads a
session's `result.json` and
`impulse_response.wav` only from inside that session's folder (a path in
`session.json` that is absolute or leads out of the folder is refused). A
`project.json` is different by design: it lists session folders, which may
live anywhere, so opening someone else's project opens the session folders it
names — look at it first. Apart from that, a way to make RoomScope read or
write outside the files you opened is a security issue.

## Safety of Standalone Mode

RoomScope plays a test sweep through a loudspeaker. Defaults stay conservative
(−20 dBFS in Standalone Mode; −12 dBFS for generated sweep files). Nothing in
this project changes system volume, audio-device configuration, or DAW
settings. Please report any change that would do so as a security issue.
