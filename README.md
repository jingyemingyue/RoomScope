**An open-source, DAW-independent recording environment analyzer.**

RoomScope answers practical questions a recording engineer asks about a room
and a microphone position:

* Is this room usable for recording?
* What acoustic problems does this position have (strong early reflections,
  long decay, low-frequency build-up, mains hum, high noise floor)?
* Did moving the microphone or the performer improve things?

It measures the room with an exponential sine sweep (ESS), derives the room
impulse response by deconvolution, and reports reverberation (EDT / T20 /
T30 / estimated RT60), frequency response, background noise, early
reflections and potential low-frequency resonances. Every number carries its
unit, its algorithm source and a validity flag; when the data is not good
enough, RoomScope says *"Insufficient decay range"* instead of inventing a
figure. There is deliberately no "room score".

> Status: **0.4.x pre-release** on the way to 1.0
> ([RELEASE_PLAN.md](docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md)). The DSP core, CLI, GUI, compare,
> loopback, zh-CN catalog, session bundles and the desktop bundles exist and
> are covered by synthetic tests on Linux, macOS and Windows. **Not yet:** any
> result measured on real hardware (the hardware matrix and the validation
> campaign are empty), signed bundles, a PyPI package. Treat the numbers as
> unvalidated until 0.5.0. Snapshot of what works: [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).

## Download

No release has been published yet. When the maintainer publishes a
pre-release, these files are attached to the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jingyemingyue/RoomScope/releases); until
then, [install from source](#install-from-source).

| System | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10/11 x64 | `RoomScope-setup.exe` (installer) or `roomscope-windows-x64.zip` |
| macOS 14+, Apple silicon | `RoomScope-macos-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS 14+, Intel | `RoomScope-macos-x86_64.dmg` |
| Linux x86_64 | `roomscope-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Any OS with Python 3.12+ | `roomscope-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` |

The bundles are **not signed for distribution** (macOS: ad hoc signature, not
notarized; Windows: no Authenticode signature): macOS Gatekeeper and Windows
SmartScreen warn on first launch. How to open them, check the `SHA256SUMS-*` files and install the
wheel is in the [user guide](docs/user-guide/en.md#install)
([简体中文](docs/user-guide/zh-CN.md#安装)).

## Two workflows, one analysis core

### Universal DAW Mode

Designed for any DAW that can import, play, record and export WAV files.
RoomScope never talks to the DAW. It reads what DAWs export (Broadcast WAV,
RF64, Wave64, AIFF, CAF, FLAC; 16/24/32-bit PCM or 32-bit float; mono or
multi-channel) and, when the sweep's sidecar file is used, names the usual
cause when the DAW played the sweep at the wrong speed (a project at another
sample rate, or a Warp / Flex / Follow Tempo stretch larger than the
estimate's own spread: about 1.3 % for the default 10 s sweep, more for
shorter sweeps).
Step-by-step notes, written from each vendor's documentation, cover Pro
Tools, Logic Pro / GarageBand, Cubase / Nuendo, Fender Studio Pro (Studio
One), Ableton Live, REAPER, FL Studio, Bitwig, Digital Performer and
Audacity: [docs/user-guide/daw-setup.md](docs/user-guide/daw-setup.md).
**None of them has been run with RoomScope in a real DAW yet**
([HARDWARE_TESTS.md](docs/HARDWARE_TESTS.md)); a DAW compatibility report is
the most useful contribution you can make.

1. **Generate Test Signal** – RoomScope writes a sweep WAV (plus a small JSON
   sidecar with the exact sweep definition).
2. **Record Through Your DAW** – import the WAV on a track, play it through
   your interface and monitors, record the measurement microphone on another
   track.
3. **Import Recording** – export the recorded track as WAV (same sample rate
   as the project; any length, no trimming needed).
4. **Analyze** – RoomScope finds the sweep automatically, deconvolves it and
   produces the report.

### Standalone Mode

RoomScope plays the sweep and records the microphone itself through the
audio interface you select (PortAudio via `sounddevice`). Start with the
monitor level low: the default sweep level is conservative and RoomScope
does not touch system volume or audio settings (the one opt-in exception, a
macOS option that sets the device's sample rate, is described in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#safety-of-standalone-mode)).

Both modes call exactly the same analysis pipeline
(`roomscope.core.pipeline.analyze`).

## Install from source

Requires Python 3.12 or newer. **Supported for 1.0:** macOS 14+ (arm64,
x86_64), Windows 10/11 x64, Linux x86_64 with glibc of the CI runner or
newer, Python 3.12–3.14 for the wheel. Anything else may work and is not
tested.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jingyemingyue/RoomScope.git
cd RoomScope
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
```

`gui` pulls in PySide6 (LGPL-3.0, large). Without it the CLI and the Python
API work fully.

## Quick start (CLI)

```bash
# 1. Generate the test signal (48 kHz, 20 Hz–20 kHz, 10 s sweep, -12 dBFS)
roomscope sweep --out sweep_48k.wav

# 2. Play it through your DAW, record the mic, export recording.wav

# 3. Analyze
roomscope analyze --recording recording.wav --sweep sweep_48k.wav --out results/

# Optional: two tape measurements unlock the vertical geometry
roomscope analyze --recording recording.wav --sweep sweep_48k.wav \
  --speaker-distance 1.65 --mic-height 0.40 --temperature 21

# Optional: interpret for a kind of recording (generic | vocal | voiceover |
# acoustic_guitar | drums | room_mic | choir)
roomscope analyze --recording recording.wav --sweep sweep_48k.wav --profile voiceover

# Re-open a saved session (same report; --profile overrides the stored one)
roomscope show results/
roomscope show results/ --list

# Compare two saved sessions (every delta carries a validity)
roomscope compare results/ position-b/ --same-input-gain
roomscope schema result

# Two-channel DAW export: microphone + electrical loopback
roomscope analyze --recording take.wav --sweep sweep_48k.wav --channel 0 --loopback-channel 1

# Standalone: list devices, then measure (optional loopback on input 2)
roomscope devices
roomscope measure --out session1/ --input-device 2 --output-device 3 \
  --input-channels 1,2 --loopback-channel 2 --sample-rate 48000

# Demo / CI: no interface
roomscope --backend fake measure --out demo/ --duration 2 --post-silence 1.5

# Language, bundle, CSV, project
roomscope --lang zh_CN analyze --recording take.wav --sweep sweep.wav
roomscope session bundle session1/ --no-audio --out report.zip
roomscope export session1/ --format csv --out curves/
roomscope project init --out room/ --name Booth
roomscope project add room/ session1/ --position desk
roomscope project average room/

# GUI (needs the gui extra)
roomscope gui
```

`--speaker-distance` is the straight line from the loudspeaker to the
microphone capsule; `--mic-height` is the capsule above the first solid
horizontal surface below it. With both, RoomScope reports the loudspeaker
height, the plane above the devices and the horizontal separation. It reports
**no coordinates, no room length or width, and never names a wall**: one
omnidirectional microphone at one position measures path lengths, not
directions, which leaves the geometry underdetermined by two even with the
distance supplied. The result JSON carries that argument with it.

`--profile` chooses how the measured numbers are turned into advice
(`generic` by default; `vocal`, `voiceover`, `acoustic_guitar`, `drums`,
`room_mic` and `choir` have per-recording thresholds and wording). The report
prints the profile name next to `Interpretation` so the advice is never
mistaken for room-agnostic truth. The GUI offers the same selector in both
measurement modes.

`results/` receives `result.json` (all metrics and curves),
`impulse_response.wav` (raw IR, float32) and `session.json` (measurement
metadata). Raw recordings are never modified. `roomscope show` and the GUI
**Open Session** / Home session list reopen that directory; the IR WAV is
the authoritative sample record (`result.json` stores metrics, not IR
samples). Recently opened or saved sessions are remembered under
`$ROOMSCOPE_HOME` (default `~/.roomscope`).

## Python API

```python
from roomscope import analyze, compare, interpret_comparison
from roomscope.io.wav import read_wav, load_reference
from roomscope.core import Reference

recording = read_wav("recording.wav")
reference = load_reference("sweep_48k.wav")  # uses the JSON sidecar if present
result = analyze(recording, reference)
print(result.decay.broadband.rt60_estimate_s, result.decay.broadband.rt60_basis)
for r in result.reflections.reflections:
    print(f"{r.delay_ms:.1f} ms  {r.relative_db:.1f} dB")
```

## What makes RoomScope different

* **It refuses to invent a number.** Every metric carries its unit, its
  algorithm source and a validity flag; a decay too short for T30 says
  *insufficient range* instead of a figure. There is no single "room score".
* **It lives next to your DAW, not inside it.** It needs only a DAW that
  plays and records WAV, and it names the usual cause when the DAW played the
  sweep at the wrong speed (sample-rate mismatch or Warp / Flex / Follow
  Tempo). The per-DAW steps are documented, not yet tested in each DAW.
* **It speaks the recording engineer's question** — "is this position usable
  for a vocal, a drum room mic, a choir?" — through labelled interpretation
  profiles, and compares two positions with a validity on every delta.
* **It says what one microphone cannot know.** Placement geometry never names
  a wall or derives coordinates the measurement cannot support.

A sourced comparison with other tools is in [docs/COMPARISON.md](docs/COMPARISON.md).

## Design principles

* **DAW-independent** – no DAW SDKs, ever. WAV in, WAV out.
* **Core-first** – DSP functions are pure NumPy/SciPy functions with no GUI,
  device or file-format dependencies, so a CLI, a desktop app, a plug-in or
  a Python API can share them.
* **Scientific correctness over features** – algorithms come from published
  papers and standards (Farina 2000, Schroeder 1965, Lundeby 1995,
  ISO 3382-1/-2, ...); see [docs/MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md).
* **Honest numbers** – dBFS unless calibrated, validity flags on every metric,
  no pseudo-scientific room score.
* **Clean-room implementation and license hygiene** – no third-party source is
  vendored ([docs/CODE_PROVENANCE.md](docs/CODE_PROVENANCE.md)); every dependency and
  every reference repository is audited
  ([docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md),
  [docs/THIRD_PARTY_REVIEW.md](docs/THIRD_PARTY_REVIEW.md)).
