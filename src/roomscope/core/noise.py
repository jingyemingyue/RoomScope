"""Background-noise analysis of a quiet segment of the recording.

All levels are digital levels in dBFS (AES17 convention: a full-scale sine
wave reads 0 dBFS RMS). Without an SPL calibration RoomScope never converts
them to dB SPL.

Choosing the quiet segment
--------------------------
:func:`quiet_segment_candidates` returns the *positions* that may hold
background noise, in order of preference: the recording before the **first**
sweep pass, then the recording well after the **last** pass. Position alone
does not make a segment quiet, so :func:`select_quiet_part` checks the
content of each candidate before it is measured:

* runs of exact digital zeros (a DAW export that starts before the recorded
  region, or a gap between regions) are dropped; the longest remaining
  contiguous piece is used. Zeros are not background noise, and averaging
  them in pulls the level down. What is left may be shorter than
  ``min_segment_s`` but is still measured down to
  :data:`MEASURABLE_SEGMENT_S`, with a note;
* the piece is split into short blocks; blocks more than
  :data:`QUIET_EXCESS_DB` above the quietest blocks (another sweep pass, a
  chair, a door) are cut away and the longest quiet run is kept;
* a "quiet" part that is less than :data:`QUIET_MIN_BELOW_SWEEP_DB` below the
  level of the sweep itself is not background noise (typically a looped sweep
  with no silence) and is rejected.

If nothing usable remains, the next candidate is tried and otherwise every
level is reported as ``None`` with a note. Levels below
:data:`NOISE_FLOOR_DBFS` are also reported as ``None``: they are digital
silence or numerical residue, not a measured acoustic noise floor.

Mains hum
---------
Hum is searched for at the two mains frequencies. The 50 Hz and 60 Hz series
share every multiple of :data:`MAINS_SHARED_MULTIPLE_HZ` (300 Hz, their least
common multiple), so a buzz on one grid always produces peaks that also fit
the other base. Only harmonics that belong to *one* base count towards
detection, and when both bases still qualify only the better-explained one is
reported as detected. The fundamental is not required: full-wave rectifier
buzz starts at twice the mains frequency.
