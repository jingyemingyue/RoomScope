"""Frequency response from the impulse response.

The raw magnitude is the FFT of the (optionally time-windowed) impulse
response and is always kept. Smoothing is a configurable fractional-octave
power average computed *from* the raw curve and stored separately.

Gating and resolution
---------------------
The analysed segment starts ``lead_in_s`` before the *direct sound* and ends
``window_s`` after it. Counting the gate from the direct sound instead of from
the first sample makes it independent of the display pre-delay, and the end
taper can no longer eat into the direct sound: a window shorter than the taper
plus :data:`MIN_DIRECT_SOUND_S` is refused instead of silently returning an
empty or attenuated response.

The lead-in keeps the pre-ringing of the band-limited direct sound, which is
part of its low-frequency content: cutting a few milliseconds before the peak
costs about 1.5 dB at 31.5 Hz on a loopback.

The FFT is zero-padded to a fine bin spacing, which *interpolates* the
spectrum; it does not add resolution. Both numbers are reported:
``bin_spacing_hz`` (the distance between exported points) and
``resolution_hz`` = 1 / analysed duration (the width of the narrowest feature
that can be separated).
