"""Optional electrical loopback (reference) channel.

One interface output drives the loudspeaker and is also returned electrically
into a second input. The deconvolved loopback must look like a pulse, not a
room: a channel that decays like a microphone recording is refused and the
analysis continues uncompensated.

Compensation is regularised spectral division (Kirkeby et al. 1998,
MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md reference [22]; the same shape
``roomscope.core.sweep.design_spectral_inverse`` uses) inside the excitation
band::

    H_room = H_mic · conj(H_lb) / (|H_lb|² + ε(f))

``H_lb`` is a short FIR cut around the loopback peak. Its time origin is the
peak: the samples before the peak are placed at negative time (the end of the
FFT frame) and the frame is zero-padded well beyond ``len(h_mic)``, so the
division is linear, not circular, and removes the interface *response*
without moving the microphone's direct sound (±1 sample; a pure-delay
interface leaves ``h_mic`` unchanged).
The loopback peak is still the electrical time zero: ``path_delay_ms`` is the
delay of the microphone's direct sound relative to it, and
``distance_upper_bound_m = c · path_delay`` is a bound (loudspeaker DSP
latency only adds delay).

Nothing here estimates clock drift: both channels share one converter clock.
