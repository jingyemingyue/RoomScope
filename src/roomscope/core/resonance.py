"""Potential low-frequency resonance detection.

v0.1 deliberately reports *candidates* only:

* a candidate is a peak of the finely smoothed (1/24-octave) magnitude
  response that stands ``min_prominence_db`` above the 1-octave smoothed
  baseline, inside the searched range (below ``max_hz``, above
  :data:`MIN_FREQUENCY_HZ`, inside the excitation band and coarse enough for
  the frequency resolution of the response);
* for each candidate the decay of a 1/3-octave band around it is measured as
  the time for the band envelope to fall 20 dB, and compared with **two**
  references measured exactly the same way: the analysis filter's own ringing
  (a band-pass of a Dirac pulse, filtered time-reversed like the measurement)
  and the *surroundings*, the median of the neighbouring 1/3-octave bands.
  ``decay_distinguishable`` requires both: at least
  :data:`DISTINGUISHABLE_RATIO` times the filter ringing (otherwise the
  measurement only shows the filter) and at least
  :data:`SURROUNDINGS_RATIO` times the neighbouring bands (otherwise the whole
  low end decays like this and the peak is not a separate resonance).

The surroundings are measured *after* notching the candidate's own 1/3 octave
out of the impulse response. A strong, long resonance is 40 dB or more above
the tail of the neighbouring bands at later times, so without the notch it
leaks through the filter skirts and the neighbours simply repeat the
candidate's own decay (measured: every neighbour of a 62 Hz mode with
RT 1.5 s in a room with RT 0.3 s read 0.50 s, the mode's own decay).

Calibration of :data:`SURROUNDINGS_RATIO` (2.0): for mode-free synthetic rooms
(exponential Gaussian tails, RT 0.25-1.0 s, seven frequencies from 63 Hz to
250 Hz, 12 seeds each) the ratio has a median of 1.0 and a 99th percentile of
2.1, with a maximum of 2.9; for added modes whose RT is twice the room's or
more it is 2.0 to 7.9. The measure has a large statistical spread at low
frequencies (B*T of a 1/3-octave band is only a few), so a candidate remains a
candidate: one position cannot establish a room mode.

Identifying an actual room mode requires knowledge of the room geometry and
several measurement positions and is out of scope.
