"""Reverberation analysis: decay onset, Schroeder integration, noise truncation,
EDT/T20/T30 and their validity.

Method (see docs/MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md for the references)
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Analysis segment and band filtering.** The caller passes a signal that
   contains the impulse response and the index of the (broadband) direct
   sound. Octave bands are IEC 61260-1 base-10 bands (``filters.iec_band``)
   filtered with time-reversed Butterworth band-passes (Jacobsen & Rindel
   1987). A time-reversed filter is anti-causal: the band signal at any time
   depends only on the input from that time on, and the filter's ringing
   appears *before* each input event (about ``4/B`` at -40 dB for bandwidth
   ``B``). The signal is therefore given a lead-in of :func:`decay_lead_in_s`
   (at least ``DECAY_LEAD_IN_MIN_S`` = 0.2 s and ``DECAY_LEAD_IN_BANDWIDTHS/B``
   of the lowest band) before the direct sound, zero-padded where the signal
   has less. The result does not depend on how much signal before the direct
   sound the caller kept (for example the display pre-delay
   ``ir_pre_delay_ms``).
2. **Onset** (start of the Schroeder integration), found separately for the
   broadband response and for each band: the first sample at which the
   squared response rises to within ``ONSET_LEVEL_DB`` (20 dB) of its
   maximum, before the direct sound. This follows the start-point rule of
   ISO 3382-1:2009, Annex A (clause not verified against the standard text;
   wording as restated by Christensen, Koutsouris & Rindel, ISRA 2013). When
   the direct sound is known, the search starts ``2 ms + 4/B`` before it
   (``B`` = the band's bandwidth, or the excitation bandwidth for the
   broadband response), so that noise, other sweep passes or harmonic
   pre-responses further ahead cannot start the decay. Without a known
   direct sound the search starts at the beginning of the signal. The EDC is
   normalised at the onset, so a band's 0 dB includes all of its
   direct-sound energy.
3. **Noise truncation** (Lundeby et al. 1995, steps as summarised by
   Karjalainen et al. 2002) on the squared response from the onset: 20 ms
   block averages, preliminary regression from the loudest block to the first
   block at noise + 10 dB (noise from the last 10 %), then iterated block length / noise / late-slope estimates
   until the crosspoint moves by less than ``LUNDEBY_CONVERGENCE_DB`` (1 dB)
   of decay at the late slope (at least 1 ms). The iterative estimate is
   rejected, and the preliminary crosspoint, slope and noise level are used
   instead, when the iteration does not converge within 6 passes, when the
   late slope is less than ``LUNDEBY_MIN_SLOPE_RATIO`` (0.5) times the
   preliminary slope, or when the crosspoint lies more than
   ``10 dB / |preliminary slope|`` plus two blocks after the first block at
   noise + 5 dB (a stationary tonal floor such as mains hum drags the late
   slope towards zero and the crosspoint to the end of the response). The
   metrics are then also computed with the rejected estimate; if any VALID
   metric changes by more than ``TRUNCATION_SENSITIVITY`` (5 %) or loses or
   gains its number, the band's metrics are marked unreliable. (Marking every
   rejected estimate unreliable would flag most bands of clean measurements
   with more than about 100 dB of range, where the late slope is fitted to a
   few blocks and oscillates without affecting the metrics.) The energy of
   the decay after the truncation point is estimated from the slope and added
   back (late-decay compensation).
4. **Schroeder curve** ``EDC(t) = sum_{tau >= t} h^2(tau)`` from the onset to
   the truncation point (Schroeder 1965), normalised to 0 dB at the onset.
   All times (curve, onset, truncation) are measured from the direct sound
   (from the start of the signal when no direct sound is given; see
   ``DecayResult.time_origin``).
5. **Fits.** EDT, T20 and T30 are least-squares line fits over 0..-10 dB,
   -5..-25 dB and -5..-35 dB, extrapolated to 60 dB (ISO 3382-1). A fit
   never starts before the end of the direct sound (the direct sound plus
   the excitation pulse spread ``4/B_exc + 0.5 ms``): before it, a
   time-reversed band response contains only the band filter's pre-ringing
   of the direct sound, not room decay. This reproduces what an ideal,
   non-smearing band filter would give, where the direct sound is a step of
   the EDC at time 0; for the broadband curve it changes nothing. The degree
   of non-linearity ``xi = 1000 * (1 - r^2)`` and the curvature
   ``C = 100 * (T30 / T20 - 1)`` are defined in ISO 3382-2:2008, Annex B.
6. **Validity** (a metric is only VALID when none of these applies):

   * *insufficient decay range*: the range from the loudest block to the
     noise floor is less than ``|lower limit| + noise_margin_db`` (ISO 3382:
     the evaluation range must end at least 10 dB above the noise);
   * fewer than 3 samples in the range, or a non-negative slope;
   * EDT only: the EDC drops by more than ``EDT_MAX_DIRECT_STEP_DB`` (5 dB)
     across the direct sound, i.e. the direct sound carries more than about
     70 % of the (band) energy. Less than half of the 0..-10 dB range is then
     room decay and EDT describes the direct sound rather than the room (with
     a step of 10 dB or more there is no room decay in the range at all);
   * B*T < ``MIN_BT_PRODUCT`` (4) for time-reversed filtering (Jacobsen &
     Rindel 1987; value confirmed only through citing works);
   * the metrics depend on a rejected Lundeby estimate (item 3);
   * *non-straight decay*: ISO 3382-2 Annex B introduces the curvature C and
     the non-linearity xi to warn when a decay is not straight and a single
     reverberation time does not describe it (for example a double slope);
     such results should be marked as less reliable. When ``|C|`` exceeds its
     limit (10 % for wide bands, growing as ``1/sqrt(B * T30)`` for narrow
     bands and short decays, see :func:`straightness_limits`), T20 and T30
     are both marked unreliable and no RT60 is estimated; when the xi of one
     fit exceeds its limit (15 permille, growing the same way), that metric
     is marked unreliable. A band warning says why. The numerical guidance of
     Annex B was not verified; the limits are RoomScope's choice, calibrated
     as documented next to the constants;
   * the band is not fully inside the excitation range
     (``Validity.OUTSIDE_EXCITATION``, no numbers at all);
   * the caller marks everything unreliable
     (:meth:`~roomscope.models.result.DecayResult.with_all_unreliable`), e.g.
     for a low direct-sound confidence or a clipped recording.

   The estimated RT60 is the VALID T30, else the VALID T20, else none.
