"""Early reflection detection on the broadband impulse response.

Method
------
1. The analytic (Hilbert) envelope of the IR is taken and a short peak-hold
   (maximum filter, ``hold_ms``) merges the ringing of one arrival into one
   peak without lowering impulsive arrivals the way averaging would.
2. The envelope is expressed in dB relative to the direct sound.
3. A local trend (moving average of the dB envelope over ``trend_ms``) models
   the diffuse energy around each instant; the *excess* of a peak over that
   trend is used as its prominence.
4. Peaks between ``min_delay_ms`` and ``max_delay_ms`` after the direct sound
   that are above ``threshold_db`` (relative to the direct sound) and have an
   excess of at least ``prominence_db`` are reported.

The result is a list of *candidate* reflections (delay, level relative to the
direct sound). In a dense diffuse tail, statistical envelope peaks can still
appear as candidates; the notes say so.
