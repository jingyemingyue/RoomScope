"""Checks that the measurement chain stayed linear.

Two failures are detected here, because both make the deconvolved impulse
response something other than the room's:

Clipping (flat tops)
--------------------
An absolute threshold (``|x| >= 0.999``) misses every recording that was
clipped and then attenuated - by a fader, clip gain or an export ceiling -
and it wrongly flags an unclipped file that was normalised to 0 dBFS.
:func:`detect_clipping` instead looks for *plateaus*: runs of at least
:data:`CLIPPING_MIN_RUN` consecutive samples at the file's own maximum
magnitude, with a slope discontinuity at both ends (a smooth crest reaches
its maximum with curvature, a clipped one with a kink). The tolerance follows
the file's quantisation step, so that a dithered export is still recognised.
Clipping in the *playback* path is a different failure and is not visible in
the recording at all; that is what the aliased-distortion probe below is for.

Aliased (digital) distortion
----------------------------
Farina's rule that harmonic products appear *before* the linear impulse
response holds only for alias-free distortion. A nonlinearity in the digital
domain at the sample rate - a clipped DAW bus, a saturator or plug-in without
oversampling, float-to-int clipping on export - folds the harmonics that
exceed the Nyquist frequency back to ``|k*f(t) - m*fs|``. For a rising sweep
those trajectories *fall*, so the ascending inverse filter spreads them over
seconds *after* the direct sound, where they look like a long decay. The
pre-peak margin and the clipping check cannot see this: the recording itself
need not clip.

:func:`aliased_distortion_levels` therefore probes for them directly. For
order ``k`` it builds the part of the k-th harmonic sweep that is folded once
(``k*f(t)`` between ``fs/2`` and ``fs``, alias ``fs - k*f(t)``), scaled like
the played sweep, and deconvolves the recording with its inverse filter
(time-reversed, ``exp(t/L)``-weighted, normalised to unit in-band magnitude
like the linear one). An aliased product then compresses into a pulse at a
known position, and its energy relative to the linear response - measured in
the same short window and the same frequency band - is the level of that
distortion product. The band is the part of the folded trajectory that is
inside the excitation band and away from the frequencies where the linear
sweep or a lower-order *non-aliased* harmonic crosses the same trajectory in
time and frequency; a floor taken from windows before the expected position
bounds whatever else disperses into that band. A product is called
significant when it stands at least :data:`ALIAS_DETECTION_MARGIN_DB` above
that floor and reaches :data:`ALIAS_SIGNIFICANT_DB` relative to the linear
response, which is where the folded products start to bend the late decay.

Limitations: the probe needs the sweep definition (a reference given only as
audio has no known phase), and it covers the orders in
:data:`ALIAS_PROBE_ORDERS` with a single fold. Harmonics that fold more than
once, or orders above those, are not probed; at 88.2 kHz and above the second
and third harmonics of a 20 kHz sweep do not alias into the swept range at
all, so the probe reports that it is not applicable.
