"""Vertical geometry from the early reflections and one tape measurement.

What this module may and may not claim
--------------------------------------
A single omnidirectional microphone at a single position measures *path
lengths*, not directions, and the deconvolved impulse response has no absolute
time origin (its zero contains the interface round-trip latency). Writing the
image-source model of a first-order reflection off a plane perpendicular to
some axis, with ``s`` and ``r`` the perpendicular distances of loudspeaker and
microphone from that plane, ``d`` their straight-line separation, ``u = s + r``
and ``v = s - r``::

    L^2 - d^2 = u^2 - v^2 = 4*s*r

Four independent arrival equations constrain six unknowns. Without a measured
``d`` the deficit is three; with it, two. The residual freedom is exactly the
*direction* of the loudspeaker-to-microphone vector: every direction
reproduces the measured arrival times, so no coordinate, room length, room
width or wall distance can be derived. What survives that freedom is::

    P := s*r = c*delta*(2*d + c*delta) / 4          (exact, per reflection)

and, once the user supplies one perpendicular distance ``h``, the whole
axis perpendicular to that plane::

    s = P / h                                       (loudspeaker side)
    H = (u + sqrt(L_upper^2 - d^2 + v^2)) / 2       (the opposite plane)
    q = sqrt(d^2 - v^2)                             (horizontal separation)

Those are the only quantities this module reports. See
:data:`~roomscope.models.result.PLACEMENT_COORDINATES_WITHHELD`, which is
emitted verbatim in the JSON.

**Source.** The image-source construction for a plane reflector is standard
(Allen & Berkley 1979 is the canonical *forward* method); the identity
``L^2 - d^2 = 4*s*r`` used here is elementary algebra from it and is
implemented clean-room. RoomScope deliberately does *not* implement
room-shape-from-echoes / echo sorting (Dokmanic et al., PNAS 110(30), 2013,
and the echo-labelling work that follows it), which is the published route to
the full geometry and requires a microphone array or several positions; see
docs/MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md.

Tiers
-----
The single code path degrades explicitly as inputs are withheld:

* **0** -- temperature only: every candidate carries its excess path in metres.
* **1** -- and ``distance_m``: the per-candidate product of perpendicular
  distances, its bounds, and the specular level ceiling.
* **2** -- and ``mic_height_m``: the vertical axis is solved.

Thresholds and their justification
----------------------------------
Tier 1 (geometry, no free choice): the level ceiling ``20*log10(d/L)``.
Tier 2 (physical plausibility, wide by design): the height and ceiling ranges.
Tier 3 (RoomScope engineering choices, not standards):
:data:`MAX_SURFACE_ATTENUATION_DB`, :data:`SPECULAR_EXCESS_TOLERANCE_DB`,
:data:`HEIGHT_AGREEMENT_M`, :data:`CEILING_AGREEMENT_M`. The level gate is a
*tier 3* screen, not pure geometry: it assumes a point source radiating into a
free field, an infinite rigid plane, and that a broadband peak-held envelope
peak is comparable with an on-axis level. It is used to withhold an
attribution, never to assert what a candidate is.
