"""Deconvolution of the recorded sweep and location of the impulse response.

Because linear convolution is shift invariant, the recording is convolved with
the inverse filter as a whole; the linear impulse response then appears at
``sweep_start + len(reference) - 1 + acoustic_delay`` in the output. Nothing is
cut before deconvolution, so no manual trimming is required from the user.

Output sample ``i`` of the full convolution depends only on recording samples
``<= i``. The part of the impulse response ``tau`` samples after the direct
sound is therefore exact as long as the recording continues for ``tau``
samples after the end of the sweep and no further excitation (a second sweep
pass) has started by then. This is what ``valid_length`` measures.

Harmonic distortion of the k-th order appears ``L * ln(k)`` before the linear
response (Farina 2000). Those windows are excluded from the direct-sound
margin and evaluated separately (:func:`harmonic_distortion_levels`).
