"""The analysis pipeline shared by the CLI, the GUI and the Python API.

recording + reference sweep
    -> channel selection and validation
    -> deconvolution (whole recording, no manual trimming)
    -> impulse response location (sweep passes, recording start check,
       excitation band, harmonic distortion indicators)
    -> linearity checks (flat-topped peaks, folded/aliased distortion products)
    -> decay analysis (broadband + octave bands, on h_full with a fixed lead-in;
       bands outside the excitation band withheld; all metrics unreliable when
       the direct sound is unverified, the recording clips or it contains
       aliased distortion)
    -> frequency response (gated from the direct sound, with a lead-in)
    -> background noise (a quiet segment of the recording, verified quiet)
    -> early reflections
    -> potential low-frequency resonances
    -> placement geometry (only what the supplied tape measurements make
