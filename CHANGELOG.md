# Changelog

All notable changes to RoomScope are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). How a version is cut is in
`docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Audio device inventory** (`roomscope.audio.inventory`, `roomscope devices
  --probe | --host-apis | --json`): every host API and device PortAudio sees,
  the sample rates each accepts for one channel (`Pa_IsFormatSupported`;
  nothing is played), PortAudio's default latencies, the entries that are one
  physical device across host APIs (MME's 31-character names included), and
  the recommended entry per device and direction (a direct path first — ALSA
  `hw:`, WDM-KS, ASIO, JACK — then the platform's host-API order). Each
  host API carries its measurement-relevant behaviour, from
  `docs/AUDIO_DEVICES.md` (+ zh-CN; 38 references: PortAudio v19.7 source,
  python-sounddevice, Microsoft, Apple, ALSA / PipeWire / JACK documentation,
  Farina 2007, Müller & Massarani 2001, Torras-Rosell & Jacobsen 2011, Novák
  et al. 2015 and others).
- **Basic support for every device path in Standalone Mode**: one host API
  per take (PortAudio refuses mixed host APIs, `paBadIODeviceCombination`;
  an unset side takes the same host API's default device instead of MME's),
  channels checked against the device before anything is played, a warning
  when playback and recording are separate devices on separate clocks, and
  `roomscope measure --latency low|high`, `--wasapi-exclusive` (no Windows
  audio engine) and `--coreaudio-set-rate` (set the macOS device rate and
  refuse to convert). WASAPI's auto-convert is deliberately not offered: it
  inserts the engine's resampler.
- `roomscope doctor`: an environment report (versions of NumPy, SciPy,
  libsndfile, PortAudio, Qt; paths; host APIs; default devices) for bug
  reports.
- Developer and installer editions (`roomscope.edition`,
  `ROOMSCOPE_EDITION`): a source or pip install is the developer edition, a
  desktop bundle the user edition. The developer edition adds a Developer
  menu (Audio Device Inspector with rate probing and JSON copy, Environment
  Report, Open Data Folder) and advanced audio options in Standalone Mode
  (latency, WASAPI exclusive, Core Audio set-rate). Settings gain *Theme*
  (system / light / dark, applied at once) and *Show developer tools*, and a
  save keeps the fields the dialog does not show.
- Standalone Mode lists devices per host API (the platform's preferred one
  preselected), stars the recommended input and output, and checks host API,
  channels and separate clocks before playing.

### Changed
- **GUI redesign.** One design system (`ui/theme.py` tokens, a generated Qt
  style sheet, Fusion on every OS so Windows, macOS and Linux render alike,
  light and dark schemes) and shared widgets (`ui/widgets.py`). Home: mode
  cards and the product's three principles; the session list shows room,
  position and local time. DAW and Standalone pages: page header, scrolling
  step cards, primary actions, safety and demo banners. Results: key figures
  (RT60, background noise, early reflections, direct-sound confidence) each
  with a validity or trust chip, findings as coloured cards with translated
  severity and topic, the band table in full; the text report moved to a
  *Full report* tab. Plots share the series palette; minor grid lines follow
  the scheme; spin and combo boxes use drawn chevrons. The window has a drawn
  app icon. All new strings are in the zh-CN catalog.
- Compare page: page header, a session-picker card and the results in tabs
  (metrics, frequency-response difference, early reflections, resonances,
  full report); the difference chart follows the scheme.
- **matplotlib>=3.10** (was >=3.8). The wheels of 3.8.0, 3.9.0 and 3.9.4
  still contain the `_ttconv` extension that DEPENDENCIES.md §6 said was gone
  from 3.8; 3.10.0 is the first without it (wheels opened 2026-09-24). With
  the other declared minimums (numpy 1.26, scipy 1.12, soundfile 0.12,
  sounddevice 0.4.6, PySide6_Essentials 6.6) the suite passes 522/522 on
  Python 3.12; with the newest releases it passes on 3.13 and 3.14.

### Fixed
- Cross-platform audit (Windows / macOS behaviour emulated in
  `tests/unit/test_cross_platform.py`): CLI output redirected to a file or
  pipe is written as UTF-8 (the locale code page raised UnicodeEncodeError on
  Δ, → or a Chinese room name); `project.json` stores session paths with `/`
  and reads `\` from projects written on Windows, and a session added twice
  is recognised by its resolved path; `roomscope session bundle` refuses a
  destination inside the session folder (the zip contained itself and grew
  without end); copying a file onto itself is detected with `samefile`
  (case-insensitive file systems); the log file keeps working when another
  process holds it during rotation (Windows); default input / output devices
  are marked again (sounddevice returns an indexable pair, not a tuple); the
  display language is read from Windows (`GetUserDefaultUILanguage`) and
  `zh-Hans-CN` / "Chinese (Simplified)" tags map to zh_CN; the session list no
  longer fails on dates Windows cannot convert; a silent recording names the
  macOS microphone permission.

### Documentation
- `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` (+ zh-CN): platforms, Python and dependency floors,
  DAW export formats, host APIs and cross-platform behaviour, each with what
  verified it (CI job, local build, test module) and what is not verified.
- `docs/EDITIONS.md` (+ zh-CN): the developer edition and the installer
  edition, what each shows, and how to switch.
- `docs/user-guide/daw-setup.md` (+ zh-CN) re-checked against each vendor's
  current manual, with a numbered source per step: Pro Tools (Apply SRC is
  not a mismatch indicator; TrackInput off still monitors while recording),
  Logic Pro 12.3 (*Flex* + *Smart Tempo* replace *Flex & Follow*), GarageBand
  (no sample-rate setting; *Export projects at full volume* normalises),
  Cubase / Nuendo (*Convert to Project Settings*, Auto Monitoring *Manual*,
  Export Selected Events *Dry*), Fender Studio Pro 8 (formerly Studio One;
  the track's *Tempo* mode), Live (*Auto-Warp Long Samples* is on by
  default), REAPER (*Allow projects to override device sample rate*),
  FL Studio (monitor and loop-record defaults), Bitwig (*Stretch* mode
  *Raw*; there is no *Off*), Audacity 3.4+ (*Record New Track*, *Export
  Audio* with *Current Selection*).
- `docs/COMPARISON.md` (+ zh-CN): a sourced comparison with REW, Open Sound
  Meter, ARTA, Smaart, SoundID Reference, ARC X, Dirac Live, HouseCurve,
  AURORA, pyroomacoustics, python-acoustics, pyrato and ITA-Toolbox, what
  RoomScope does differently, and when another tool is the better choice;
  README gains "What makes RoomScope different".

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-24

Patch release: closes the review follow-ups #9–#17, each with a synthetic
test that fails on 0.4.0, and makes the desktop bundles and the DAW workflow
usable by someone other than the maintainer (Packaging, DAW workflow). No new
measurement, no dependency change at run time. Still no hardware result,
still unsigned, still private. 0.4.0 was never tagged; because #17 had to be
fixed before any bundle is published (RELEASE_PLAN.md §4), 0.4.1 is the
first version meant for a draft Release.

### Fixed
- **Bundle gate (#17).** `scripts/check_bundle_contents.py` matches GPL-only
  Qt QML modules by directory (`qml/QtQuick/VirtualKeyboard`,
  `qml/QtQuick/Timeline`, `qml/QtCharts`, `qml/QtGraphs`,
  `qml/QtDataVisualization`, `qml/QtQuick3D`, `qml/Qt/labs/lottieqt`, also
  inside a macOS `.app`), whose plugin files do not carry the module name
  (`libqtvkbpinyinplugin.so`); `--strip` removes them and the directories it
  empties. A frozen tree that contains any file under a `qml/` directory now
  fails the gate, because RoomScope has no QML UI. A Linux PyInstaller
  6.22.3 build from `requirements/bundle.lock` was built locally: it has no
  `qml/` directory and passes `--strip`.
- **Simplified Chinese (#14).** The catalog now covers all seven profiles
  (28 more findings), and the words inserted into sentences (decay length,
  direction of an RT60 change, noise segment) are translated through
  `pgettext` while findings keep the English word in `params`. The
  Standalone safety warning and the `--acknowledge-level` refusal were
  already translated on `main`; they are now marked for extraction. A
  catalog `.mo` is never written at run time any more (0.4.0 wrote one into
  the installed package); the wheel ships a `.mo` compiled by the build hook
  in a temporary directory, used only while its recorded SHA-256 matches the
  `.po`. Tests run with a pinned English locale. New test: every message
  extracted from `src/` has a translation with the same placeholders, and
  `--lang zh_CN analyze --profile drums|room_mic|acoustic_guitar|choir`
  prints no English finding text.
- **Loopback time origin (#12).** The interface FIR's time origin is now its
  peak (samples before it at negative time) and the division is linear
  (padded frame), so compensation no longer advances the response by the
  5 ms pre-roll; the sweep start and reflection delays stay within one
  sample of the uncompensated analysis. The electrical-settling check
  subtracts the noise floor (estimated at the end of the valid record) from
  the energy before it finds the 99 % point, so a clean loopback with a long
  post-roll is no longer refused, while a close microphone in a live room is
  still refused. `compensate()` now requires `fir_peak_index` (keyword-only):
  the old implicit origin at the FIR's first sample reproduced the shift.
  Kirkeby et al. 1998 is in the methodology references.
- **PortAudio callback (#13).** Progress is reported from the waiting thread,
  never from the real-time callback; an exception in the callback aborts
  the stream and fails the take instead of returning zeros; a stream that
  ends early is an error; Stop no longer waits for the timeout when the
  device has stalled; buffer under/overflow flags are logged. Hardware
  inputs (1-based) and recording columns (0-based) are mapped by
  `plan_input_channels` and validated before anything is played; a loopback
  on the microphone input is refused up front. Sessions store the 1-based
  interface channels of a Standalone take and leave them empty in Universal
  DAW Mode (the CLI stored the 0-based column before).
- **Comparison (#9).** Frequency responses are smoothed on their own grid
  before they are sampled on the comparison grid; the per-octave MAD of two
  takes that differ only in the diffuse tail drops from about 3 dB to below
  1 dB in the 4–16 kHz octaves. A decay band present on one side only is
  reported whichever side lacks it.
- **Imported impulse responses (#10).** The sweep-pass search is skipped
  when there is no sweep: on a loud file it ran in quadratic time (a 6 s
  sweep WAV did not finish in five minutes) and on real IRs it could hide
  the decay and the reflections. A file that is not an impulse response
  (pre-peak margin below 10 dB; the stretch just before the peak is
  excluded for max(2 ms, 2 / declared upper band edge), so a declared
  sub-woofer IR passes) is refused, as is an IR whose direct sound is
  weaker than a later arrival. `analyze-ir` now has tests.
- **Session loader (#11).** `result.json` / `impulse_response.wav` are read
  only from inside the session folder; absolute or escaping paths (and
  symlinks leading out) are refused. Incomplete comparison and calibration
  records raise `SessionError` instead of `TypeError`.
- **ISO 3382-2 classes (#15).** Table 1 is now the standard's (4.3.1:
  combinations 2 / 6 / 12, source positions ≥ 1 / ≥ 2 / ≥ 2, microphone
  positions ≥ 2 / ≥ 2 / ≥ 3, read from the standard's preview pages); 0.4.0
  asked for 3 / 6 microphone positions and did not check them for
  engineering. Every row is checked, including the number of
  source–microphone combinations. `roomscope project average` counts
  distinct position labels, not sessions, so repeated takes at one position
  are no longer labelled a survey-class spatial average; `--sources 0` is
  refused.
- **Source safety check (#16).** `scripts/check_src_safety.py` resolves
  import aliases (`np.load`), reports `from os import system`, star imports
  from `os` / `numpy`, the `os.exec*` / `os.spawn*` / `os.fork` families and
  `asyncio.create_subprocess_*`, and treats `importlib.import_module` /
  `__import__` like an import. It is a lint, not a sandbox.
- Methodology reference numbers [17] / [18] were used twice; Allen & Berkley
  and Dokmanić et al. are now [20] / [21].
- `mypy --strict` is also clean when the PySide6 6.11 typed stubs are
  installed.

### Changed
- The `dev` extra lists `hatchling` (MIT; already the build backend) so the
  wheel build-hook test runs in CI (DEPENDENCIES.md §2).
- `SECURITY.md` names the supported versions and how files received from
  other people are treated; `docs/HARDWARE_TESTS.md` gains two rows
  (no logged buffer problem in a full take; an unplugged device is reported
  as a failure) and says what the automated backend tests do not show.
- Coverage of `core` + `models` (branch coverage, the CI gate's measure) is
  90.20 % (87.74 % on 0.4.0); the run is recorded in `docs/STATUS.md`.

### DAW workflow
- **Wrong sweep speed is diagnosed.** A DAW that plays the test signal at the
  wrong speed (a 48 kHz file in a 44.1 kHz project without conversion, a
  project exported at another rate, Warp / Flex Time / Follow Tempo / elastic
  audio) made the analysis report only "direct-sound detection confidence is
  low" or "recording is shorter than the reference sweep".
  `roomscope.core.playback_speed` measures the sweep rate in the recording
  (for every frequency bin the frame where the passing sweep peaks; a
  Theil-Sen line through time against ln f) and names the cause: a
  sample-rate mismatch when the played rate is within 2.5 % of a common rate,
  otherwise a time-stretch. It runs only when direct-sound detection
  confidence is low (a medium margin means the sweep did deconvolve), marks the decay unreliable, is stored as
  `impulse_response.playback_speed` in `result.json` (optional, additive
  schema field), and is added to the "shorter than the reference" and
  "starts after the sweep began" errors. New findings
  `measurement.playback_sample_rate` / `measurement.playback_time_stretch`
  replace the generic direct-sound finding; both are translated. Synthetic
  tests: a sweep played unconverted at 44.1 / 88.2 / 96 kHz, a 44.1 kHz
  project exported at 48 kHz, ±3 % stretches, a sweep-less noise file.
- **DAW export formats.** New tests analyse the same take as Broadcast WAV
  with `bext` / `iXML` / `JUNK` chunks (Pro Tools), WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE,
  RF64, Wave64, AIFF, CAF (Logic Pro recordings) and FLAC, at 16 / 24 /
  32-bit PCM and 32-bit float, and stereo bounces of a mono microphone. The
  GUI's recording dialog lists all of those extensions (it offered only
  `.wav .flac .aif .aiff`, so Logic's CAF files and `.w64` exports were
  hidden) plus *All files*.
- **Per-DAW guide.** `docs/user-guide/daw-setup.md` (and zh-CN): the rules
  every DAW must follow (sweep at the project rate, no time-stretching, no
  plug-in or room correction on the playback path, one loudspeaker, input
  monitoring off, one pass, whole export without normalising), step-by-step
  notes for Pro Tools, Logic Pro / GarageBand, Cubase / Nuendo, Studio One,
  Ableton Live, REAPER, FL Studio, Bitwig Studio and Audacity, and a table
  from each report message to its DAW cause. The notes come from the DAWs'
  documentation; `docs/HARDWARE_TESTS.md` gains an empty per-DAW matrix for
  checking them. The GUI's Step 2 text names those rules.

### Packaging
- **macOS app opens the GUI.** `RoomScope.app` has its own windowed
  executable, so a Finder launch without arguments opens the GUI; the DMG is
  mounted, copied and launched in the release workflow
  (`scripts/check_macos_dmg.py`).
- **Windows and Linux desktop launch.** The bundles gain a windowed
  `roomscope-gui` launcher next to the console `roomscope`, sharing its
  libraries. Started without arguments (Explorer, the Start menu, a desktop
  file, the AppImage `AppRun`) it opens the GUI; before, those launches ran
  the console CLI, which printed its usage and exited, so a double-click
  never showed a window. With arguments both executables are the CLI.
- **Windows installer.** The release workflow installs Inno Setup when the
  runner lacks it and always builds `RoomScope-setup.exe` (per-user, no
  administrator rights; Start-menu and optional desktop shortcuts to
  `roomscope-gui.exe`; upgrades replace the previous libraries). The
  installer is written to `dist/` (it went to `packaging/windows/Output`),
  its version comes from `pyproject.toml` via `/DMyAppVersion`, and the
  workflow installs it silently, smoke-tests the installed copy and
  uninstalls it.
- **Build without GitHub Actions.** `scripts/build_release.py` runs the
  release workflow's bundle job on the local machine (tests, license bundle,
  PyInstaller, `--strip` gate, smoke test, archive / installer / DMG,
  `SHA256SUMS-<OS>-<ARCH>`, optionally wheel and sdist) with the workflow's
  file names, and refuses packages that differ from `requirements/bundle.lock`;
  `docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md` §3a describes publishing such a build by hand.
- `scripts/smoke_bundle.py` also runs `gui --smoke` through the windowed
  launcher; `--require-gui-launcher` fails a Windows / Linux bundle without
  one.
- Release notes open with a download table, the unsigned-bundle warning and
  links to the user guide; the README has a Download section and the user
  guide's install section names every Release file, the checksums, the Linux
  system libraries and the wheel install (RoomScope is not on PyPI yet).
- **Intel Macs.** The release workflow also builds on an Intel macOS runner;
  the disk images are `RoomScope-macos-arm64.dmg` and
  `RoomScope-macos-x86_64.dmg` (was `RoomScope.dmg`, Apple silicon only),
  each checked for its own architecture, and the checksum files are named per
  runner OS and architecture (`SHA256SUMS-macOS-ARM64`, ...).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

First pre-release. Everything below was developed against synthetic rooms;
no hardware result is claimed, the desktop bundles are unsigned, and the
repository is still private. Review follow-ups are tracked as issues
#9–#16 (see `docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md` §6).

### Added
- Release plan (`docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md`, zh-CN digest): version ladder
  0.4.0 → 0.4.x → 0.5.0 → 1.0.0rc1 → 1.0.0 with the gates for each, and
  the version-driven release pipeline: a version change in `pyproject.toml`
  on `main` builds sdist/wheel, unsigned bundles for Linux, macOS and
  Windows, a CycloneDX SBOM and checksums, and opens a **draft** GitHub
  Release; publishing the draft is the maintainer's decision and is what
  creates the tag. PyPI upload runs only on a tag and only when the
  repository variable `ROOMSCOPE_PUBLISH_PYPI` is `true`. The workflow
  file itself is installed by the maintainer (RELEASE_PLAN.md §3).
- Verbatim LGPL-3.0, GPL-3.0 and PortAudio license texts under
  `packaging/licenses/`; `scripts/build_license_bundle.py` ships them in
  `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/_texts/` and fails when PySide6 is installed but
  the LGPL / GPL texts are missing (DEPENDENCIES.md §3–§4). The About
  notice points at those files.
- `scripts/check_bundle_contents.py --strip` deletes GPL-only Qt modules
  and ASIO DLLs from a frozen tree before the gate runs. The gate now
  recognises versioned Linux libraries (`libQt6QuickTimeline.so.6`),
  macOS framework binaries and the `Qt6`-prefixed file names
  (`Qt6VirtualKeyboard.dll`), which the previous name check missed;
  `--require-licenses` also requires the verbatim texts.
- 1.0-rc software that does not need hardware or a public flip: GUI
  Placement tab and tape-measure fields (S5); Python 3.14 in the CI
  matrix (S6); the M11 validation protocol with pre-chosen tolerances
  (`docs/VALIDATION.md`); `requirements/bundle.lock`; `CODEOWNERS`; docs
  link check; 85 % coverage gate on `core` and `models`; `docs/index.md`
  hub; fixtures README; keyboard shortcuts for every main action; plots
  use linestyle as well as colour; GitHub Actions pinned by SHA; themed
  documentation site (`scripts/build_docs_site.py`, S7); matplotlib / Qt
  chrome follows the system dark mode; Standalone shows the device rate
  next to the requested rate and calls `check_sample_rate` before a
  measurement; Compare lists matched reflections, resonances, loopback
  deltas and per-octave MAD; Help opens the license bundle or
  `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`. JSON reads cap nesting depth as well as size;
  settings, recents and sweep sidecars use the same reader.
  `scripts/check_src_safety.py` bans network imports, pickle, eval and
  shell-outs under `src/`. Unsigned-bundle packaging adds Inno Setup, a
  Linux desktop/AppRun, a macOS dmg script, zip/tar archives and
  `scripts/smoke_bundle.py` (fake-backend measure, offscreen GUI).
  Linux x86_64 and Windows win_amd64 wheels of numpy/scipy/soundfile/
  sounddevice/matplotlib/Pillow were opened
  (`scripts/audit_wheel_contents.py`); the Windows sounddevice wheel
  ships ASIO DLLs that the bundle gate strips. `load_comparison` and
  `roomscope show comparison.json` re-derive findings (they are never
  stored); robustness tests cover comparison.json, more WAV/sidecar cases
  and a microphone used as loopback. CLI `--help`, text-report labels,
  DAW / Standalone / Results chrome and the remaining CLI messages go
  through gettext.
- v0.4 for everyone (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md milestone 0.4): gettext with a
  Simplified Chinese catalog for the `generic`, `vocal` and `voiceover`
  profile findings, the report labels, GUI chrome and CLI help (the other
  four profiles and the Standalone safety warning still fall back to
  English — #14); `--lang` / `settings.language` / `ROOMSCOPE_LANG`; user
  settings under `$ROOMSCOPE_HOME/settings.json`; self-contained sessions
  (sweep sidecar always copied, recording copied on `--copy-recording` /
  the GUI default); `roomscope session bundle` (`--no-audio`); project
  folders and `average_decay` (SHOULD; the ISO 3382-2 class thresholds are
  a secondary-source transcription, see #15); CSV exporter and
  `roomscope export`; user guide in English and Chinese; macOS
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and audio-input entitlement. `--json` is
  deprecated in favour of `--format json` (stderr warning only).
- v0.3 trust-the-chain (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md milestone 0.3): optional
  loopback compensation (`core/loopback.py`, `--loopback` /
  `--loopback-channel`); `AudioBackend` protocol with a fake backend and a
  PortAudio callback stream that honours progress and Stop; CLI
  `--backend`; GUI Demo mode, Stop, and a loopback channel; robustness
  tests and a JSON size cap; CI on Linux, macOS and Windows; hardware
  matrix started in `docs/HARDWARE_TESTS.md` (no cell is marked PASS).
- v0.2 reopen-and-compare (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md milestone 0.2): lazy Tier 1
  exports on `import roomscope`; lenient `from_dict` loaders; shipped JSON
  Schemas and `roomscope schema`; `compare()` of two `AnalysisResult`s with
  a validity on every delta; CLI `roomscope compare` and `analyze-ir`;
  `interpret_comparison`; GUI pick-two compare view with an explicit
  "input gain unchanged" checkbox. `jsonschema` is a dev dependency used
  only in tests.
- Session re-opening: `AnalysisResult.from_dict` rebuilds a saved result;
  `load_measurement` reloads `session.json` + `result.json` + the IR WAV;
  `list_sessions` finds session directories. CLI `roomscope show` prints a
  saved report (`--list` browses a folder). The GUI Home page has Open
  Session, Browse Folder and a recent-session list; File → Open Session
  does the same. Saves and opens are remembered under `$ROOMSCOPE_HOME`
  (`~/.roomscope` by default). `MeasurementSession.recording_profile`
  records which interpretation was used.
- v1.0 architecture design (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_V1.md`, Chinese digest in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE_V1.zh-CN.md`): public API tiers, schema policy,
  session comparison, loopback reference channel, audio backend interface,
  internationalisation, packaging and release pipeline, quality and
  validation gates, milestones with exit criteria, and the decisions
  reserved for the maintainer.
- GitHub project files so other developers can clone, review and open pull
  requests: CI (pytest on Python 3.12/3.13, ruff, mypy, sdist/wheel), issue
  and pull-request templates, Dependabot, Contributor Covenant, and a
  security policy.
- Project foundation: Apache-2.0 license, architecture and methodology
  documents, dependency / third-party / provenance / license-decision audits.
- Python package `roomscope` (src layout, typed, ruff + mypy clean).
- DSP core: exponential sine sweep generation with analytic (Farina) and
  regularised spectral inverse filters; whole-recording deconvolution with
  automatic impulse-response location; Schroeder decay with Lundeby noise
  truncation and late-decay compensation; EDT / T20 / T30 / estimated RT60
  per ISO 3382-1 evaluation ranges with validity flags; time-reversed
  octave-band filtering with B*T check; frequency response with
  fractional-octave smoothing; background noise (dBFS, PSD, 50/60 Hz hum
  detection); early-reflection candidates; potential low-frequency
  resonance candidates.
- Placement geometry (`core/placement.py`): the vertical axis derived from the
  early reflections plus one or two tape measurements, in three tiers that
  degrade explicitly as inputs are withheld. Reports the loudspeaker height,
  the plane above both devices and the horizontal separation; never a
  coordinate, a room length or width, or a named wall, because one
  omnidirectional microphone at one position leaves the system underdetermined
  by two even with a measured loudspeaker distance. New CLI flags
  `--speaker-distance`, `--mic-height`, `--temperature`.
- Measurement session model and JSON/WAV storage.
- CLI: `roomscope sweep | analyze | devices | measure | gui`.
- Interpretation layer with a generic recording profile.
- Recording profiles (`interpretation/profiles.py`): seven profiles —
  generic, vocal, voiceover, acoustic_guitar, drums, room_mic, choir — with
  per-profile reflection/decay/noise thresholds and tailored advice on top of
  shared measurement-integrity checks. CLI `--profile` (`--profile vocal`),
  `Interpretation (<profile> profile):` in the report, and a profile selector
  in both GUI measurement modes.
- Minimal PySide6 GUI (Universal DAW Mode, Standalone Mode, results tabs).
- Synthetic test suite (unit, integration, offscreen GUI smoke tests).

### Changed
- The optional `gui` extra depends on `PySide6_Essentials` only, so a
  developer install does not pull GPL-only Qt Addons modules. `roomscope.ui.qt`
  defines `PySide6.__version__` so matplotlib's QtAgg backend still imports.
- The new release workflow attaches archives and checksums only (not the
  unpacked bundle directories), pins PyInstaller to `>=6.11,<7`, restricts
  `contents: write` to the draft-release job, and names archives by
  version and platform.

### Fixed
- The installed-wheel audit test failed on macOS CI: numpy's
  `macosx_14_0_arm64` wheel (what `macos-latest` installs) links Apple
  Accelerate and bundles no shared library at all, while the
  `macosx_11_0` wheel bundles OpenBLAS with libgfortran / libquadmath under
  `numpy/.dylibs/`. The test accepts either layout and rejects a mixed one;
  DEPENDENCIES.md §6 records both. (An earlier fix attributed the failure
  to `RECORD` omitting the `.dylibs/` folder; that was not the cause.)
- Comparison findings quote ISO 3382-1's "not enough to call the change
  significant" disclaimer. The 0.2 test now requires that wording instead
  of forbidding the word "significant".
- The wheel build includes each shipped `*.schema.json` file without
  adding `roomscope/schemas/__init__.py` twice.
- The results overview now names the recording profile that produced the
  findings. It previously always printed `generic`.
- Loopback deconvolution tests asserted a time-domain IR peak of 1.0 after
  inverse filters were changed to unit *in-band* gain. They now compare
  against `reference_pulse()`. Methodology docs matched the implementation.
