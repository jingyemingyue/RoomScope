# How RoomScope compares

[简体中文](COMPARISON.zh-CN.md)

Last checked: 2026-09-24. Facts about other tools come from their own pages,
manuals and repositories (see *Sources*). Prices, editions and platforms
change, so check with the vendor. *Not documented* means we did not find the
point in those sources, not that the feature is missing. Corrections are
welcome as an issue or pull request.

## Who RoomScope is for

RoomScope is for recording engineers, students and home recordists who have
three questions about a room and a microphone position: *can I record here,
what is wrong with this position, and did moving the microphone or the
performer help?* RoomScope measures, reports and compares. It does not correct
a monitoring system, simulate a room or tune a PA.

RoomScope is a **pre-release (0.4.x)**. Synthetic tests cover its DSP on
Linux, macOS and Windows, but no result has yet been measured on real hardware
and checked against a reference instrument ([STATUS.md](STATUS.md),
[HARDWARE_TESTS.md](HARDWARE_TESTS.md)). Most tools below are mature products
with years of field use.

## What RoomScope does differently

Other tools already do some of what follows. REW marks RT60 figures it
considers unreliable, Smaart falls back from T30 to T20 when the decay does
not clear the noise, and dual-channel analysers (Smaart, ARTA, Open Sound
Meter) use a reference channel. What RoomScope adds is the combination, aimed
at recording positions, and a policy of refusing a number instead of guessing
one.

- **Every number has a unit, an algorithm source and a validity flag.**
  Field names carry the unit, and every metric's algorithm and literature
  reference are documented. Each metric is marked `valid`,
  `insufficient_decay_range`, `unreliable`, `outside_excitation_range` or
  `not_computed`. EDT, T20 and T30 need at least 20, 35 and 45 dB of decay
  range respectively (the ISO 3382 noise margin). With less, the report says
  *"Insufficient decay range"* and gives the measured range. Levels are
  dBFS; dB SPL would need a calibration, and 1.0 ships none. RoomScope
  deliberately has no single "room score"
  ([MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md](MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md) §3, §9;
  `src/roomscope/models/result.py`).
- **Two modes, one analysis pipeline.** In Universal DAW Mode, RoomScope
  writes a sweep WAV, you play and record it in any DAW, and RoomScope
  analyses the export. RoomScope never talks to the DAW: there is no SDK and
  no plug-in. It finds the sweep anywhere in an untrimmed file, so you don't
  need to set a latency, and it reads Broadcast WAV, RF64, Wave64, AIFF, CAF
  and FLAC. In Standalone Mode, RoomScope plays and records through an audio
  interface itself. Both modes call `roomscope.core.pipeline.analyze`
  ([user-guide/daw-setup.md](user-guide/daw-setup.md)).
- **It explains a sweep the DAW played at the wrong speed.** When
  deconvolution fails, RoomScope measures the sweep rate in the recording
  (a Theil–Sen fit of the sweep's time against log frequency). It then
  reports either a sample-rate mismatch ("a file generated at 48000 Hz was
  played at 44100 Hz") or a time-stretch (Warp, Flex, Follow Tempo). This is
  only a diagnosis: RoomScope never re-analyses the recording at the measured
  speed (MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md §2b).
- **Recording profiles, labelled as interpretation.** The advice comes from
  a recording profile, never from the DSP. The profiles are generic, vocal,
  voiceover, acoustic guitar, drums, room mic and choir, and each has its own
  thresholds and wording. The report prints the profile name next to
  "Interpretation", so nobody mistakes the advice for a room-agnostic verdict
  (§8).
- **Placement geometry limited to what one microphone can measure.** From
  reflection delays, plus an optional tape-measured loudspeaker distance and
  microphone height, RoomScope reports the loudspeaker height and the height
  of the surface above. It gives no coordinates, no room length or width, and
  never names a wall: one omni microphone at one position measures path
  lengths, not directions. When two arrivals could explain a value, both are
  listed and neither is picked (§7a).
- **Optional loopback compensation.** An electrical return of the interface
  output is checked first: it must behave like an electrical pulse. It then
  divides the interface's response out of the measurement and gives the
  electrical time origin. If the channel still carries room sound, RoomScope
  rejects it, says why, and analyses without compensation (§2a).
- **Comparing sessions, with a validity on every delta.** A comparison of
  two positions answers "did moving help?". A decay delta exists only when
  both sides are valid, noise deltas need the input gain declared unchanged,
  and no change is called "significant" on the evidence of one pair (§11).
- **English and Simplified Chinese; Apache-2.0 with clean-room provenance.**
  Findings, the GUI, CLI help and the user guide are translated
  ([user-guide/zh-CN.md](user-guide/zh-CN.md)). Core diagnostic strings stay
  in English on purpose ([ARCHITECTURE_V1.md](ARCHITECTURE_V1.md) §5.6). All
  DSP was written from papers and standards. No third-party source code is
  included, and every repository studied during the design was
  license-audited ([CODE_PROVENANCE.md](CODE_PROVENANCE.md),
  [THIRD_PARTY_REVIEW.md](THIRD_PARTY_REVIEW.md)).

"Through a DAW" means that a DAW or another recorder can play the test
signal and record the microphone, with the tool analysing the files. For
correction products, the column says where the correction runs.

## When another tool is the better choice

- **EQ and room-correction filter design, waterfalls, room simulation.**
  REW finds response peaks automatically, assigns and optimises EQ filters
  for many hardware and software equalisers, and draws waterfalls and
  spectrograms. It also has a room simulator. RoomScope designs no filters.
- **Correcting a monitoring system.** SoundID Reference, ARC X and Dirac
  Live measure in order to correct, and HouseCurve generates filters for
  hi-fi and home systems. RoomScope only measures. To measure a corrected
  system with RoomScope, keep the correction in the playback path on purpose
  ([user-guide/daw-setup.md](user-guide/daw-setup.md), item 3).
- **Live sound and real-time transfer functions.** Smaart and Open Sound
  Meter show live dual-channel FFT results with program material and
  coherence. RoomScope works offline, one sweep at a time.
- **Clarity, STI and the wider ISO 3382 set.** REW Pro (STI), Smaart Suite
  (STI, clarity), ARTA and AURORA report clarity, definition or STI; RoomScope
  reports EDT, T20, T30, estimated RT60, frequency response, noise, early
  reflections and potential low-frequency resonances.
- **Calibrated SPL or certified measurements.** RoomScope reports dBFS only;
  its band filters are not certified IEC 61260 class 1, and one source and one
  microphone position do not reach the ISO 3382-2 survey class (methodology
  §3). ARTA can act as a virtual IEC class 1 SPL meter with a calibrated
  microphone, and Smaart has an SPL mode.
- **Room simulation and research scripts.** pyroomacoustics simulates rooms;
  pyrato and ITA-Toolbox compute room parameters in Python or MATLAB.
- **Results proven in the field today.** RoomScope has no hardware
  validation yet. Until 0.5.0, treat its numbers as unvalidated.

## What RoomScope deliberately does not do

Taken from [MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md](MEASUREMENT_METHODOLOGY.md) §9 and
[ARCHITECTURE_V1.md](ARCHITECTURE_V1.md) §3.3:

- No room score.
- No auto-EQ and no room correction; correction filter design is densely
  patented (methodology §10).
- No dB SPL without calibration; every level in 1.0 is dBFS.
- No room-mode identification, only *potential* low-frequency resonances
  (methodology §7).
- No plug-in hosting, and no VST3/AU/AAX plug-in in 1.0.
- No room geometry beyond the vertical axis: no coordinates, no room length
  or width, no wall names. A room's full shape from echoes needs a microphone
  array or several positions; two positions would be exactly determined, so
  future multi-position support must add a redundant third.
- Spatial averaging combines T values only, never decay curves.
- No clock-drift estimation between separate playback and recording devices,
  and no automatic two-sweep scheme (both are covered by in-force patents).
- No cloud, accounts or telemetry.
