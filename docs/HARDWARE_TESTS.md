# Hardware test matrix

ARCHITECTURE_V1.md §7.3: executed at least once per platform before 1.0
(M10) and recorded here with the date, the RoomScope version and the
interface. Community results are accepted through the measurement issue
template with a bundle attached.

Nothing below is marked PASS that was not run on real hardware. This file
is the started matrix for milestone 0.3; the cells are empty on purpose.

| Check | macOS | Windows | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Device enumeration | | | |
| Sample-rate negotiation 44.1 kHz | | | |
| Sample-rate negotiation 48 kHz | | | |
| Sample-rate negotiation 96 kHz | | | |
| Channel mapping beyond 1–2 | | | |
| Loopback capture | | | |
| Stop during playback (output silent within one callback) | | | |
| Full take without a logged buffer under/overflow (`roomscope -v measure`) | | | |
| Device unplugged during a take is reported as a failure, not a recording | | | |
| Full Standalone measurement | | | |
| Same signal through one DAW (Universal DAW Mode) | | | |

Record a row as `PASS YYYY-MM-DD, RoomScope x.y.z, <interface name>` or
`FAIL` with an issue link. Do not fill a cell from the fake backend.

What the automated tests do and do not show: `tests/unit/test_audio_backend.py`
runs the synthetic `fake` backend, and `tests/unit/test_portaudio_backend.py`
drives `PortAudioBackend`'s real callback code through a scripted stand-in
for `sounddevice` (progress from the waiting thread, callback exceptions,
early stream end, Stop, status flags). Neither touches PortAudio or an
interface, so neither fills a cell above; the Stop test in particular sets
the cancel flag itself (#13).
