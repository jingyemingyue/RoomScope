# RoomScope user guide

RoomScope measures a recording room so you can hear what the room is doing to
close-miked sources. It does not score the room and it does not correct it.

This page is the English guide. The Chinese translation is
[zh-CN.md](zh-CN.md).

## Install

Download from the project's
[Releases page](https://github.com/jingyemingyue/RoomScope/releases). Each
Release lists `SHA256SUMS-*` files; compare them with the file you
downloaded (`shasum -a 256 <file>` on macOS / Linux,
`Get-FileHash <file>` in PowerShell).

| System | File | Start RoomScope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10/11 x64 | `RoomScope-setup.exe` (installer) or `roomscope-windows-x64.zip` | Start menu → RoomScope, or `roomscope-gui.exe` in the zip |
| macOS 13+, Apple silicon | `RoomScope-macos-arm64.dmg` | Drag RoomScope to Applications, then open it |
| macOS 13+, Intel | `RoomScope-macos-x86_64.dmg` | Drag RoomScope to Applications, then open it |
| Linux x86_64 | `roomscope-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `tar xzf roomscope-linux-x86_64.tar.gz && roomscope/roomscope-gui` |

The Windows and Linux bundles carry two programs: the desktop app
`roomscope-gui` and the command-line tool `roomscope` (run `roomscope --help`
in a terminal). On macOS the app's executable is also the CLI when it is given
arguments: `/Applications/RoomScope.app/Contents/MacOS/RoomScope --help`.

**The bundles are unsigned** until the maintainer holds signing identities,
so the operating system warns the first time:

* **macOS:** right-click the app → Open, or System Settings → Privacy &
  Security → Open Anyway after Gatekeeper blocks it. Grant microphone access
  when asked (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` is in the bundle Info.plist).
* **Windows:** SmartScreen may warn; choose “More info” → “Run anyway”. The
  installer installs for the current user and needs no administrator rights;
  uninstall from Settings → Apps.
* **Linux:** the tarball needs the system's PortAudio, OpenGL/EGL and
  XCB libraries (on Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libportaudio2 libegl1
  libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-cursor0`). `packaging/linux/roomscope.desktop`
  is a desktop entry you can adapt.

**From Python.** RoomScope is not on PyPI yet. With Python 3.12 or newer,
install the wheel attached to the Release into a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv roomscope-env
roomscope-env/bin/pip install "./roomscope-<version>-py3-none-any.whl[gui]"
roomscope-env/bin/roomscope gui
```

Leave out `[gui]` for the CLI and the Python API only. `pip install -e ".[gui]"`
is the developer install from a clone.

The About dialog and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/` list Qt, libsndfile and the other
bundled licenses.

## Universal DAW Mode

1. `roomscope sweep --sample-rate <project rate> --out sweep.wav` (or the GUI
   “Universal DAW Mode” generate button, with the project's sample rate).
   Keep the `.roomscope-sweep.json` sidecar next to the WAV.
2. Import the WAV on a new DAW track, with time-stretching (Warp, Flex,
   Follow Tempo) off and no plug-in on its path. Route it to one loudspeaker.
3. Arm a second track with the measurement microphone, input monitoring off,
   and record while the sweep plays. Export the recorded track whole, without
   trimming or normalising.
4. Optional loopback: bounce a two-channel export (microphone + electrical
   return) and pass `--channel 0 --loopback-channel 1`.
5. `roomscope analyze --recording take.wav --sweep sweep.wav --out session/`
   or drop the files in the GUI.

## Standalone Mode and the loopback cable

`roomscope devices` lists interfaces. `roomscope measure --out session/` plays
the sweep and records. `--input-channels 1,2 --loopback-channel 2` records an
electrical return on input 2.

Start at a low monitor level. Levels above −12 dBFS need `--acknowledge-level`
every time; that confirmation is never saved.

**Demo** (GUI or `roomscope --backend fake measure`) runs the same flow on a
synthetic room. Nothing is sent to a loudspeaker.

### Per platform

`roomscope devices` prints each device with its host API in brackets.

* **Windows.** Every interface is listed once per host API. Prefer
  `[Windows WASAPI]` (or `[Windows WDM-KS]`); avoid `[MME]` and
  `[Windows DirectSound]`, which pass through the Windows mixer. In shared
  mode WASAPI only runs at the device's shared-mode format
  ([Microsoft: Device formats](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/device-formats)):
  set it to the measurement rate in the Sound control panel (Control Panel ▸
  Hardware and Sound ▸ Sound ▸ the device ▸ Properties ▸ Advanced ▸ *Default
  Format*), and set *Audio enhancements* to Off (Settings ▸ Sound ▸ the device)
  ([Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-sound-or-audio-problems-in-windows-73025246-b61c-40fb-671a-2535c7cd56c8)). Allow desktop apps to use the microphone
  (Settings ▸ Privacy & security ▸ Microphone). The bundles carry no ASIO
  support (the ASIO DLLs are built with Steinberg's proprietary SDK and are
  removed, DEPENDENCIES.md §3); an interface that only works through ASIO is
  measured in Universal DAW Mode.
* **macOS.** Core Audio. Allow RoomScope in System Settings ▸ Privacy &
  Security ▸ Microphone; without that permission the recording is silent and
  RoomScope reports *"recording is silent"*. Set the interface's rate in Audio
  MIDI Setup, and combine separate input and output devices into an
  aggregate device there if needed.
* **Linux.** ALSA through the system PortAudio (`libportaudio2`). A `hw:`
  device gives the interface's own rates; `pipewire`, `pulse` or `default`
  go through the sound server, which may resample: RoomScope shows the
  device rate next to the requested one before measuring. Your user may need
  to be in the `audio` group.

## Reading a result

Each metric has a validity flag. `insufficient_decay_range` means the number is
withheld, not that it is zero. There is no single score.

Core diagnostics (`warnings`, `notes`, `reason`) stay in English in
`result.json` so bug reports compare across languages. The UI shows them
verbatim under a heading that says so.

The Results page has seven tabs:

| Tab | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Broadband and octave-band EDT / T20 / T30 / RT60 with validity; the text report; core diagnostics (always English). |
| Impulse Response | The deconvolved IR. The peak is the direct sound; it is not normalised to 1.0. |
| Frequency Response | Raw (dotted) and smoothed (solid) magnitude. A dashed curve is the electrical loopback when compensation ran. 0 dB is the interface, not “flat in the room”. |
| Decay | Schroeder / energy-decay curves. Broadband is a solid line; octave bands use changing dash patterns so colour is not the only cue. |
| Noise | Quiet-segment spectrum and 50/60 Hz hum candidates. |
| Early Reflections | ETC peaks (delay ms, level dB re direct). Open markers for candidates. |
| Placement | Excess path, and — only with a tape-measured loudspeaker distance — loudspeaker height, the plane above both devices, and horizontal separation. No wall is named. |

Low-frequency resonance candidates stay in the Overview text report (and in
`resonances.csv` after `roomscope export`). They are not a separate tab.

## Placement

The Results page has a Placement tab. Without a tape-measured loudspeaker
distance RoomScope only reports each arrival's excess path. With the
distance (and, for the vertical axis, the microphone height) it reports
loudspeaker height, the plane above both devices and the horizontal
separation. It never names a wall or gives room length or width.

Enter the tape numbers in Universal DAW Mode or Standalone Mode before
Analyze, or pass `--speaker-distance` / `--mic-height` / `--temperature`
on the CLI.

## Comparing two positions

`roomscope compare baseline/ candidate/ --same-input-gain` (or the GUI Compare
page). A decay delta is only VALID when both sides are VALID. The noise delta
needs an explicit “input gain unchanged” declaration. A change is never called
significant; ISO 3382-1’s just-noticeable difference for T is quoted as context.

The Compare page lists matched early reflections (delay ±0.5 ms) and
low-frequency resonances (within 1/6 octave, with decay-distinguishable
flags). `roomscope compare … --out comparison.json` writes the numbers only;
`roomscope show comparison.json` prints the report again and **re-derives**
findings (they are never stored in the file).

## Projects and averaging

A project folder holds `project.json` and ordinary session folders.
`roomscope project init --out room/ --name Booth` then
`roomscope project add room/ session/ --position desk`.
`roomscope project average room/` averages VALID T values only, never decay
curves, and names the ISO 3382-2 class the position counts reach.

## Export and language

`roomscope export session/ --format csv --out curves/` writes every curve.
`--lang zh_CN` (or Settings → Language, or `ROOMSCOPE_LANG`) translates
findings, the text-report labels, the GUI and CLI help (`roomscope --help`
and every subcommand). Units stay untranslated; digits stay ASCII.
Core diagnostic strings from `roomscope.core` stay English.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Direct-sound confidence not high | Wrong sweep sidecar; loudspeaker distortion; trim the recording? Do not trim. |
| Wrong reference | The `.roomscope-sweep.json` next to the WAV must be the file RoomScope wrote for *this* sweep (same duration, band and fades). A sweep from another session, or the recording used as the reference, will mis-locate the IR. |
| Multiple passes in one bounce | Play the sweep once. Two passes in the same WAV look like two IRs; RoomScope keeps the strongest peak and the rest becomes “room”. Bounce a single take. |
| Clipping warning | Lower playback or input gain. |
| Insufficient decay range | Longer sweep, slightly louder playback, or a quieter room. |
| Device rate mismatch | The GUI shows the device rate next to the requested one; pick a supported rate. |
| Loopback refused | The return must look like an electrical pulse, not a room. If the second channel is another microphone, compensation is refused and the analysis continues uncompensated. |

## Bug-report bundle

`roomscope session bundle session/ --out report.zip` zips the folder.
`--no-audio` leaves the WAVs out if you do not want to share a recording of
the room. Attach the zip to a measurement issue. Settings and the rotating
log live under `$ROOMSCOPE_HOME` (`~/.roomscope` by default).
