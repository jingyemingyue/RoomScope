# Measurement methodology

Every quantity RoomScope reports is listed here with its algorithm source,
unit, computation conditions, validity rule and known limitations. All DSP is
an independent implementation from the cited publications and standards
(see CODE_PROVENANCE.md). Bibliographic details were verified against the
publishers' records on 2026-09-17; items that could only be confirmed through
secondary sources are marked.

## 1. Excitation: exponential sine sweep (ESS)

**Source.** Farina (2000) [1], Farina (2007) [2], Müller & Massarani (2001) [3];
ISO 18233:2006 [11] endorses swept-sine excitation for room acoustics.

**Formula** (`core/sweep.py`). With `L = T / ln(f2/f1)`:

```
x(t) = sin( 2*pi*f1*L * (exp(t/L) - 1) ),    0 <= t < T
f(t) = f1 * exp(t/L)
```

Defaults: 48 kHz, 20 Hz–20 kHz, 10 s, peak −12 dBFS, sin²/cos² fades of
50 ms / 10 ms, 1 s of silence before and 3 s after. Supported sample rates:
44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, 192 kHz. The user chooses duration, start/end
frequency, fades, level and silences.

**Why these defaults.** Müller & Massarani recommend short half-cosine fades
to avoid switching noise while keeping ripple < 0.1 dB, and starting below /
ending above the band of interest [3]. Farina (2007) shows most pre-ringing
comes from the fade-out and band limiting [2]; a very short fade-out is a
compromise between his "no fade-out, sweep to Nyquist" advice and DAW
compatibility (a file that ends at Nyquist is resampled unpredictably by
some DAWs). The silence after the sweep captures the decay; the silence
before it is the quiet segment for the noise analysis.

**Level safety.** The default is conservative and RoomScope never changes
system volume. Standalone Mode defaults to −20 dBFS and needs an explicit
acknowledgement above −12 dBFS.

## 2. Inverse filter and deconvolution

**Analytic inverse** (`core/sweep.py::inverse_filter`, Farina [1] §5):
the time-reversed sweep with an amplitude envelope `exp(-t/L)` (−6 dB per
octave), which compensates the −3 dB/octave energy spectrum of the log sweep
[3]. Both inverse filters are scaled so that the *in-band magnitude* of the
sweep convolved with its inverse is 1 (median of `|X(f)·I(f)|` over the inner
part of the excitation band). A perfect loopback therefore has a 0 dB
frequency response. The time-domain peak of the resulting band-limited pulse
is *not* 1: it is roughly `2 · bandwidth / fs` (about 0.82 for the default
48 kHz sweep) and drops further when the direct sound falls between samples.
Levels are read from the frequency response, not from `peak_value`.

**Spectral inverse** (`inverse_filter_spectral` / `design_spectral_inverse`):
when the reference is an arbitrary WAV without a RoomScope sweep definition,
a Kirkeby-type regularised spectral division is used (Farina 2007 [2]
§3.1). `H_inv = conj(X) / (|X|² + β(f))` with a frequency-dependent
`β(f) = P_ref(f) · 10^(b(f)/10)`, where `P_ref(f)` is the pink trend of the
reference and `b(f)` is small inside the estimated excitation band
(`SPECTRAL_REG_IN_BAND_DB`) and large outside it
(`SPECTRAL_REG_OUT_OF_BAND_DB`), with sin² transitions in log frequency.
Same in-band normalisation as the analytic inverse. A constant `β` would
boost the inverse just below `f1` and above `f2`.

**Deconvolution** (`core/deconvolution.py`): full linear convolution of the
whole recording with the inverse filter (FFT). Because the convolution is
zero-padded (linear, not circular), harmonic distortion products of the
loudspeaker land *before* the linear response at `Δt_k = L·ln(k)` for the
k-th harmonic [1][3] and are never wrapped into the IR.

**Impulse-response location.** The direct sound is taken as the strongest
sample of the deconvolved signal. The IR keeps `ir_pre_delay_ms` (5 ms)
before it and up to `ir_max_length_s` (6 s) after it, limited by how much
recording exists after the sweep (`valid_length_s`). The *pre-peak margin*
(dB between the peak and the strongest content in the 0.5 s window ending
2 ms before it) is reported and mapped to a confidence: high ≥ 20 dB,
medium ≥ 10 dB, low otherwise. A low margin means distortion pre-responses,
noise or a wrong reference; findings and reflection notes say so.

**Sample rates.** If the recording's rate differs from the sweep definition,
the reference is regenerated at the recording's rate (this is what the DAW
effectively played) and a warning is recorded. A WAV-only reference is
resampled with `scipy.signal.resample_poly`.

**Limitations.** A strong reflection louder than the direct sound (rare, but
possible with the microphone close to a wall and far from the source) would
be taken as t = 0; the confidence margin does not catch that case. Clock
mismatch between separate playback and recording devices smears high
frequencies [2]; Standalone Mode uses one full-duplex device, Universal DAW
Mode inherits whatever clocking the DAW/interface provides.

## 2a. Loopback reference channel

An optional electrical return of the same interface output that drives the
loudspeaker (`core/loopback.py`). Both channels share one converter clock;
nothing here estimates or corrects drift.

**Validation.** The loopback recording is deconvolved with the same inverse
filter as the microphone. The result must be an electrical pulse: high
direct-sound confidence, no clipping, 99 % of the energy after the peak
inside `MAX_ELECTRICAL_SETTLE_MS` (10 ms), and the strongest sample 5–80 ms
later at least `MIN_LATE_PEAK_DROP_DB` (25 dB) down. A channel that still
carries room energy is refused with that reason and the analysis continues
uncompensated (`LoopbackResult.compensation_applied = false`).

**Compensation.** A short FIR around the loopback peak is divided out of
the microphone's deconvolved response by regularised spectral division
`H_room = H_mic · conj(H_lb) / (|H_lb|² + ε(f))`, with the same in-band /
out-of-band regularisation shape as `design_spectral_inverse` (Kirkeby-type;
Müller & Massarani [3] §"reference measurement"). The FIR is time-aligned
to the start of the array so compensation removes the interface *response*
and does not shift the acoustic time origin. On a synthetic interface the
median absolute frequency-response error against the dry room, over the
normalisation band, is required to stay below `COMPENSATION_TOLERANCE_DB`
(1.0 dB). `FrequencyResponseResult.reference` then reads
`relative dB (0 dB = the interface loopback)`.

**Time origin.** `path_delay_ms` is the microphone peak minus the loopback
peak. `distance_upper_bound_m = c · path_delay` is a bound: loudspeaker DSP
latency only adds delay, so the true loudspeaker-to-microphone distance is
at most this value. A tape-measured `placement_distance_m` that exceeds the
bound marks the placement figures unreliable.

## 3. Reverberation: EDT, T20, T30, estimated RT60

**Source.** Schroeder (1965) [4] for backward integration; Lundeby et al.
(1995) [5] for noise truncation and compensation (step list as reproduced by
Karjalainen et al. 2002 [15]); ISO 3382-1:2009 [9] / ISO 3382-2:2008 [10] for
evaluation ranges and the noise margin; Jacobsen & Rindel (1987) [6] for
time-reversed filtering.

**Procedure** (`core/decay.py`):

1. Band filtering: Butterworth band-pass (3 poles per skirt, second-order
   sections) for octave bands 63 Hz–8 kHz (base-2 edges `fc·2^(±1/2)`,
   IEC 61260-1 [12]), applied *time-reversed* so that the filter's own decay
   precedes the room decay. The filters are not certified IEC 61260 class 1.
2. Lundeby truncation (iterative, max 6 passes): 20 ms local averages, noise
   from the last 10 %, regression from the peak to noise + 10 dB, cross-point,
   new interval (5 intervals per 10 dB, clamped 1–50 ms), noise re-estimated
   from 7.5 dB of decay after the cross-point (at least the last 10 %), late
   slope over 15 dB starting 7.5 dB above noise, repeat until the cross-point
   moves < 1 ms. These parameter values are RoomScope's choices within the
   ranges published by Lundeby (10–50 ms; 3–10 intervals/10 dB; 5–10 dB;
   10–20 dB).
3. Schroeder curve: `EDC(t) = Σ_{τ≥t} h²(τ)` from the decay start (peak of the
   smoothed energy) to the truncation point, plus the late-decay
   compensation `C = p(t_c)·(−10 / (slope·ln 10))` (energy of the extrapolated
   exponential tail). Normalised to 0 dB at the start.
4. Least-squares line fits over the ISO 3382-1 ranges and extrapolation to
   60 dB: EDT 0…−10 dB (×6), T20 −5…−25 dB (×3), T30 −5…−35 dB (×2). The
   ISO "degree of non-linearity" `ξ = 1000·(1 − r²)` (‰) is reported.
5. **Validity.** A metric is reported only when the available decay range
   (peak level of the smoothed energy minus the estimated noise floor, in dB)
   is at least `|lower limit| + 10 dB`: 20 dB for EDT, 35 dB for T20, 45 dB
   for T30 (ISO 3382: the evaluation range must lie ≥ 10 dB above the noise
   [9][10], restated by Hak et al. 2012 [17]). Otherwise the metric is
   `insufficient_decay_range` with the numbers in `reason`.
6. **B·T check.** With time-reversed filtering the bandwidth × reverberation
   time product should exceed about 4 (about 16 with forward filtering) [6];
   below 4 the band's metrics are marked `unreliable` and a warning explains
   why. The numbers 16 / 4 are confirmed only through works citing [6].
7. **Estimated RT60** is T30 when valid, else T20, else none; the basis is
   always reported. Curvature `C = 100·(T30/T20 − 1)` % is given when both
   exist.

**Units.** Seconds; the Schroeder curve in dB relative to its start.

**Limitations.** One source and one microphone position correspond to the
ISO 3382-2 *survey* level at best; no spatial averaging is performed. Very
short decays in low bands are limited by the filters (B·T rule). The
truncation parameters differ from those in other packages (ODEON, ITA
Toolbox), so small systematic differences to other tools are expected [19].

## 4. Frequency response

**Source.** Standard FFT of the impulse response; fractional-octave
smoothing as power averaging in a `±1/(2n)`-octave window (a common
engineering definition; no standard governs it).

**Procedure** (`core/frequency_response.py`). Optional gating window
`fr_window_s` (default: the whole valid IR, 5 ms half-cosine end taper when
gated); FFT length chosen for ≥ 1 Hz resolution; magnitude in dB relative to
the loopback reference (0 dB = flat). The raw curve is always stored; the
smoothed curve (default 1/6 octave, configurable, 0 = off) is stored
separately and labelled.

**Limitations.** Relative dB only; the absolute gain of loudspeaker, mic and
preamp is included. No phase display in v0.1.

## 5. Background noise

**Source.** AES17-2020 [18] for the dBFS definition (0 dBFS = RMS of a
full-scale sine); Welch (1967) for the PSD estimate.

**Procedure** (`core/noise.py`). Quiet segment = recording from 50 ms after
the start to 100 ms before the detected sweep start (≥ 0.5 s), else the file
tail 3 s after the sweep end (flagged as possibly containing reverberation),
else none. Reported: RMS in dBFS (sine reference), peak dBFS, octave-band RMS
levels (zero-phase filtered), Welch PSD (Hann, 2 Hz resolution), and mains
hum candidates: for 50 Hz and 60 Hz, harmonics up to 1 kHz whose PSD peak
(±2 Hz) exceeds the median of the ±15 % neighbourhood by ≥ 10 dB; "detected"
means ≥ 2 such harmonics.

**Units.** dBFS and dB re FS²/Hz. **Never dB SPL** without calibration, which
v0.1 does not support.

**Limitations.** The pre-sweep segment is only as quiet as the DAW routing
allows (e.g. monitor bleed); the hum thresholds are engineering choices.

## 6. Early reflections

**Source.** Energy-time-curve inspection after Heyser (1971) [16]; onset
detection considerations from Defrance et al. (2008) and Usher (2010).

**Procedure** (`core/reflections.py`). Hilbert envelope with a 0.1 ms
peak-hold, expressed in dB relative to the direct sound; a 6 ms moving
average of the dB envelope models the local diffuse level; peaks between
0.8 ms and 80 ms after the direct sound, above −20 dB re direct and at least
6 dB above the local trend, are reported as candidates `(delay_ms,
relative_db)`.

**Limitations.** Candidates, not identified surfaces. In a dense early
diffuse tail some candidates are statistical. Delays are relative to the
detected direct sound (see confidence above).

## 7. Potential low-frequency resonances

**Source.** Decay-time-versus-frequency reasoning after Karjalainen et al.
(2002) [15] and Mäkivirta et al. (2003); no standard exists. The related
Genelec patent US 7,742,607 expired in 2022 (see §10).

**Procedure** (`core/resonance.py`). Below 300 Hz, peaks of the 1/24-octave
smoothed response that stand ≥ 6 dB above the 1-octave smoothed baseline are
candidates. For each, a 1/3-octave band-pass (2 poles per skirt,
time-reversed) is applied and the time for the band envelope to fall 20 dB
is compared with the same measure for the filter alone; the decay is called
distinguishable only when it is ≥ 2× the filter ringing.

**Limitations.** "Potential resonance" only. Identifying a room mode needs
room dimensions and several positions; RoomScope does not claim it.

## 7a. Placement geometry

**Source.** The image-source construction for a plane reflector is standard
(Allen & Berkley 1979 [17] is the canonical *forward* method). The identity
used here is elementary algebra from it and was implemented clean-room; no
code was taken from any image-source library (see `docs/CODE_PROVENANCE.md`).
The published route to *full* room geometry from echoes — room-shape-from-
echoes / echo sorting, Dokmanić et al. (2013) [18] and the echo-labelling
work following it — requires a microphone array or several positions and is
deliberately **not** implemented (§9).

**What is identifiable.** With `s` and `r` the perpendicular distances of
loudspeaker and microphone from a plane, `d` their straight-line separation,
`u = s + r` and `v = s − r`, a first-order arrival of excess path `c·δ` gives

    L² − d² = u² − v² = 4·s·r ,   so   P := s·r = c·δ·(2d + c·δ)/4

exactly, with no assumption about room shape. Four independent arrival
equations constrain six unknowns: the deficit is **three** without a measured
`d` and **two** with it. The residual freedom is exactly the *direction* of
the loudspeaker-to-microphone vector, and every direction reproduces the
measured arrival times, so no coordinate, room length, room width or wall
distance is derivable from one omnidirectional microphone at one position.
The rank of the observation map is asserted in
`tests/unit/test_placement.py::test_single_position_identifiability_is_what_the_docstring_claims`
rather than only stated here.

**Procedure** (`core/placement.py`), one code path degrading by tier:

* **Tier 0** (temperature only): each candidate's excess path in metres,
  `c = 331.3·√(1 + T/273.15)` (343.2 m/s at 20 °C; numerically the ISO 9613-1
  form). 20 °C is assumed when none is given, and `temperature_assumed`
  records that it was.
* **Tier 1** (`--speaker-distance`): per candidate `P`, its square root
  `√P` — the geometric mean of the two perpendicular distances, so the nearer
  of the pair is at most `√P` and the farther at least `√P` — the exact
  two-sided bracket `[√P, L/2]` on their *arithmetic* mean, and the specular
  ceiling `20·log₁₀(d/L)`.
* **Tier 2** (`--mic-height`): `s = P/h`, the plane above both devices
  `H = (u + √(L_upper² − d² + v²))/2`, and `q = √(d² − v²)`.

The tier-2 question is phrased as *the first solid horizontal surface below
the microphone* — the desk top at a desk, otherwise the floor. That dissolves
the desk-versus-floor ambiguity by definition; no acoustic evidence from one
omnidirectional microphone could resolve it.

**Thresholds by tier of justification.** Tier 1, no free choice: the specular
ceiling. Tier 2, physical plausibility deliberately wide: loudspeaker
0.10–3.00 m, plane above 1.80–6.00 m with 0.30 m clearance. Tier 3,
RoomScope engineering choices calibrated against synthetic arrivals, not
standards: `MAX_SURFACE_ATTENUATION_DB = 12`,
`SPECULAR_EXCESS_TOLERANCE_DB = 2`, `HEIGHT_AGREEMENT_M = 0.08`,
`CEILING_AGREEMENT_M = 0.12`, `MAX_HYPOTHESIS_CANDIDATES = 8`.

The level screen is **tier 3, not geometry**: it assumes a point source in a
free field, an infinite rigid plane, and that a broadband peak-held envelope
peak may be compared with an on-axis level. It is used only to *withhold* an
attribution, never to assert what an arrival is.

**Refusals.** Unique-or-refuse throughout: when two arrivals both survive the
gates and disagree by more than the agreement threshold, every competing value
is listed and none is chosen — picking the earliest is wrong exactly in the
commonest setup (a desk edge arrives before the desk top) and picking the
loudest is wrong whenever the lower plane is carpeted. Nothing at all is
reported when direct-sound confidence is not `high`, because every delay is
measured from that origin.

**Limitations.** The reported `input_uncertainty_m` propagates the stated
tape, temperature and peak-location uncertainties **only**; model error
(flatness, rigidity, first-order specularity, and the user having measured to
a different plane than the one that reflected) is excluded and is usually
larger. The reflection search resolves arrivals no closer than 0.3 ms, so a
microphone near the vertical midpoint of a room produces one merged peak
instead of a floor and a ceiling arrival; when no separate upper plane is
found and a plausible one would have merged with the arrival used, the height
is marked `unreliable` and the user is told to move the microphone 20–30 cm
and measure again. A truncated search window does not drop arrivals at
random — it drops the longest paths first — so any height derived from what
remains is biased low, and that is stated rather than implied.

## 8. Interpretation layer

Findings are produced from the result by a recording profile
(`interpretation/profiles.py`), never by the DSP. The interface is fixed in
v0.1 so profiles can be added without touching the DSP; every profile shares
the measurement-integrity checks — low direct-sound confidence, clipping,
insufficient decay range — and the low-band / mid-band imbalance rule
(low bands decaying > 1.5× slower than mid bands), and keeps its own
thresholds and wording for reflections, decay, noise and resonances.
Thresholds are coarse engineering choices and are stated in each finding's
evidence.

The seven profiles and their section thresholds:

| Profile | Reflection (≥ dB re direct, ≤ ms) | RT60 notice / warning (s) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| generic | −10 / 30 | 0.6 / 1.0 | Default; any close-miked recording |
| vocal | −12 / 25 | 0.5 / 0.8 | Close-miked lead or backing vocals; noise advice assumes compression |
| voiceover | −14 / 20 | 0.4 / 0.7 | Voice-over, narration, audiobook; flags the weakest reflections |
| acoustic_guitar | −10 / 30 | 0.7 / 1.1 | Comb filtering from early reflections |
| drums | −6 / 20 | 0.8 / 1.2 | Only a hard slap is reported; noise findings skipped (the kit masks the floor) |
| room_mic | −5 / 40 | 0.9 / 1.4 | The room is the instrument; long decay is not automatically a defect |
| choir | −12 / 30 | 0.8 / 1.3 | Ensembles: decay helps ambience but blurs diction |

The default is `generic`; `roomscope analyze --profile vocal` and the GUI
profile selector pick another. The report prints the profile name
(`Interpretation (vocal profile):`) so the advice is never mistaken for
room-agnostic truth.

## 9. Things RoomScope deliberately does not do

No room score, no auto-EQ or correction, no dB SPL without calibration, no
room-mode identification, no plug-in hosting, no spatial averaging.

No room geometry beyond the vertical axis of §7a: no coordinates, no room
length or width, and no wall is ever named. The published method for the full
problem — room shape from echoes / echo sorting, Dokmanić et al. (2013) [18] —
needs a microphone array or several measurement positions, which RoomScope
does not require of its users. Two microphone positions with a fixed
loudspeaker would be *exactly* determined (twelve equations, twelve unknowns),
which means a zero residual would prove nothing about whether the surfaces
were assigned correctly; any future multi-position support must therefore ship
with a redundant third position, not with two.

## 10. Patents

A Google Patents search (2026-09-17, not a legal opinion) found no in-force
patent claiming ESS generation with inverse-filter deconvolution, Schroeder
integration, ISO 3382 evaluation, ETC-based reflection detection or
decay-versus-frequency resonance detection as such; these methods are
published 1965–2003 prior art. Two in-force patents to stay clear of by
design: US 9,959,883 B2 (automatic two-sweep pass-band scheme) and
US 10,816,391 B2 (clock-drift correction between unsynchronised emitter and
receiver devices). Room-*correction* filter design is densely patented
(Dirac, Sonarworks, Audyssey/Sound United, DTS, Harman); RoomScope measures
and reports only.

## 11. Comparing two sessions

`roomscope.core.compare.compare` takes two `AnalysisResult` objects and
returns a `ComparisonResult`. It is a pure function: it never changes either
result. Findings are re-derived by `interpret_comparison` and are not stored
as truth.

Comparability. The common excitation band is the intersection of both
`excitation_band` ranges. Sample rates may differ. Different sweep durations
or levels are allowed and noted. The pair is refused when the common band is
narrower than one octave (`CompareSettings.min_common_band_octaves`, default
1.0).

Decay. A delta exists only when *both* metrics are VALID; otherwise the
delta is `not_comparable` and carries both reasons. The report quotes the
just-noticeable difference for T that ISO 3382-1 gives (about 5 %; clause
not verified against the standard text) and never calls a change
"significant" on its own: single-position repeatability is not established
by one pair.

Frequency response. Both raw magnitude curves are interpolated onto a shared
logarithmic grid inside the common band and then smoothed with the coarser
of the two `smoothing_fraction` values. The difference curve is candidate
minus baseline. Mean absolute difference is reported per IEC 61260-1 octave
band that overlaps the common range.

Early reflections. Matched by delay within ±0.5 ms
(`CompareSettings.reflection_match_ms`). Unmatched arrivals are listed as
appeared or disappeared. Both sides must have high direct-sound confidence.

Noise. RMS and band deltas are VALID only if both sessions have a verified
quiet segment *and* the caller declares the input gain unchanged
(`CompareSettings.same_input_gain`). Otherwise the delta is UNRELIABLE with
the reason "gain not declared equal".

Resonances. Matched within 1/6 octave
(`CompareSettings.resonance_match_octaves`). The decay-distinguishable flags
are compared, not a decay-time delta.

Placement. Tier-2 heights are compared when both results are tier 2;
otherwise the placement deltas are `not_comparable`.

Loopback. `path_delay_ms` is compared only when both results applied
loopback compensation.
