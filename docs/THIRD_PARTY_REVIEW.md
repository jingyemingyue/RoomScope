# Third-party repository review

Audit date: 2026-09-17. Every repository that was studied while designing
RoomScope is registered here with the result of its license check. The full
records (repository URL, author, commit/tag, verbatim license header,
multiple-license check, file headers, vendored code, NOTICE/COPYRIGHT/AUTHORS
files, patent statements, obligations, and the URL of every fact) are in
[research/reference_repos.md](research/reference_repos.md).

**Result: no source code was copied or adapted from any repository.** All of
them were used as *conceptual references* (feature design, algorithm names,
architecture ideas) or as ordinary dependencies. See CODE_PROVENANCE.md.

| python-soundfile | https://github.com/bastibe/python-soundfile | BSD-3-Clause (bundled libsndfile LGPL-2.1+, dynamic) | no | no as a pip dependency | Dependency (public API only). |

## Rules applied

* Repositories without a LICENSE file, or with a license that conflicts
  between README and source headers, are treated as **not usable**; only
  their publicly described functionality was considered.
* GPL/AGPL/LGPL projects were never copied, translated, or decompiled.
  Studying their documentation for feature scope is allowed and was done
  (DRC, Aliki).
* Proprietary software (REW) was consulted only through its public
  documentation for feature ideas; no binaries were inspected.
* MIT/BSD projects could have been adapted with attribution, but the core
  DSP was implemented independently from the papers and standards instead
  (project brief §2.5 D). If that changes, CODE_PROVENANCE.md and NOTICE must
  be updated first.

## Audit limitations (carried over from the full record)

DRC and Aliki source tarballs were not downloaded (licenses taken from their
documentation / download pages); ITA-Toolbox's HEAD commit and bundled
third-party list were blocked by the GitLab anti-bot challenge; only one or
two source files per repository were checked for license headers; build-time
dependencies of the audited projects were not audited to license-file level.
