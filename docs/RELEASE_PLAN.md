# RoomScope release plan

Status: adopted 2026-09-24. This document says which versions RoomScope
will cut, what each one must prove before it is cut, and how a release is
mechanically produced. It does not change the scope contract in
[ARCHITECTURE_V1.md](ARCHITECTURE_V1.md) §3; it schedules it. A Chinese
digest is in [RELEASE_PLAN.zh-CN.md](RELEASE_PLAN.zh-CN.md); the English
text is authoritative.

No dates. The exit criteria are the schedule (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md §10).

## 1. Where the project stands (2026-09-24)

* `main` carries the v0.1 foundation plus milestones 0.2 (reopen and
  compare), 0.3 (trust the chain), 0.4 (for everyone) and the 1.0-rc
  *software* items (Placement tab, validation protocol, packaging
  scaffolding, robustness). They were reviewed and merged on 2026-09-24
  (PRs #5, #6, #7, #8); the review findings are GitHub issues #9–#16.
* No tag and no published Release exist yet (v0.4.1 is a draft). The
  repository has been public since 2026-09-24.
* **Update (2026-09-24, later the same day):** the review follow-ups
  #9–#17 (#17, the QML part of the bundle gate, was found after this plan
  was written) are fixed on the branch `v0.4.1-review-followups`, which
  sets the version to 0.4.1. Because #17 had to be closed before any
  bundle is published (§4), 0.4.0 is not expected to get a Release of its
  own: once that pull request is merged with CI green, the first draft
  Release is v0.4.1. Nothing else in this plan changes.
* Everything that requires a person in a real room is **not** done: the
  hardware matrix ([HARDWARE_TESTS.md](HARDWARE_TESTS.md)) has no PASS cell
  and the validation campaign ([VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md)) has not been
  run. The maintainer has no measurement hardware available in the near
  term, so those items are scheduled last and may be filled by
  contributors after the repository opens.
* Signing identities, the PyPI project name and trusted publishing are
  maintainer decisions and are still open (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md §13); the
  public flip was made on 2026-09-24.

## 2. Version ladder

| Version | Purpose | Must be true before it is cut | Not claimed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0.4.0** | First pre-release: everything on `main` today, as a draft Release with unsigned bundles for the maintainer's own testing | CI green on Linux / macOS / Windows and Python 3.12–3.14; `ruff`, `mypy`, the schema job and the bundle gates pass; the license bundle carries the verbatim LGPL-3.0 / GPL-3.0 / PortAudio texts; `CHANGELOG.md` has a `[0.4.0]` section; `docs/STATUS.md` has a dated snapshot | Any hardware result; a person installing a bundle on macOS / Windows; PyPI; public availability |
| **0.4.x** | Software readiness before community hardware validation (the maintainer's phase definition, 2026-09-24): the review follow-ups #9–#17 (all closed in 0.4.1), packaging, device diagnostics, the GUI, the DAW guide and the community report templates | CI and the Release workflow green on the release commit; every new behaviour has a synthetic or scripted test; `CHANGELOG.md` names what changed; no hardware or DAW claim | Any hardware or DAW result; signing; PyPI |
| **0.5.0** | "Trusted by a human": the first version whose Standalone Mode and DAW workflow were run on real hardware at least once | One dated PASS row per cell of the hardware matrix on at least one platform (device enumeration, sample-rate negotiation, channel mapping, loopback capture, Stop during playback, a full Standalone measurement, the same signal through one DAW); #12 and #13 (loopback time origin, real-time callback) closed; #14 (zh-CN catalog complete, safety warning translated) closed; #15 (ISO 3382-2 table source) closed | The validation campaign; API / schema freeze; signing |
| **1.0.0rc1** | Freeze and prove (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md §10, row 1.0-rc) | No open MUST item of §3.1: hardware matrix executed at least once per platform (M10); validation campaign published with its data (M11); signed bundles or an explicit maintainer decision to ship unsigned (M9); public-repository checklist executed (M13, §9.1); API and schema integers frozen; SECURITY / CONTRIBUTING / STATUS updated for the freeze; PyPI pre-release if trusted publishing is configured | — |
| **1.0.0** | Release | Fixes from the candidate only; release notes name the validation results and the known limitations | — |

Minor releases between these rows are allowed whenever a MUST or SHOULD
item lands and CI is green on every platform; patch releases are for fixes
only (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md §9.2).

## 3. How a release is produced

The pipeline is `.github/workflows/release.yml`
([source](../.github/workflows/release.yml)). It is driven by the version
in `pyproject.toml`, and the maintainer keeps the last word.

> **Workflow status (2026-09-24).** The version-driven workflow has been on
> `main` since PR #18; the v0.4.1 draft Release was opened from it and is
> refreshed whenever `pyproject.toml`, the workflow, `packaging/` or
> `scripts/smoke_bundle.py` change on `main` while `v0.4.1` has no tag. The
> Windows job builds and installs `RoomScope-setup.exe` on every run. Check
> the latest `main` run and the draft's assets before publishing.

1. **Prepare the release commit on `main`.** Set `project.version` in
   `pyproject.toml` to the new version (no `.dev` suffix). Move the
   `[Unreleased]` entries of `CHANGELOG.md` under a `## [<version>] -
   <date>` heading. Add a dated snapshot to `docs/STATUS.md` that says what
   was actually run. Re-check `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` §3–§4 if any dependency
   version changed. Commit and push (or merge the PR).
2. **CI opens a draft.** Because `pyproject.toml` changed on `main` and no
   tag `v<version>` exists, the workflow runs lint, type-check and the
   test suite, builds sdist and wheel, builds the unsigned bundles on the
   three OS runners (license bundle → PyInstaller → strip GPL-only Qt
   modules and ASIO DLLs → bundle gate → smoke test → archive → checksums),
   produces the SBOM and lock file, and opens a **draft** GitHub Release
   named `v<version>` with the CHANGELOG section as its body and every
   archive attached. **No tag exists at this point.** A version containing
   `.dev` never opens a draft.
3. **The maintainer decides.** Download the bundles from the draft and try
   them on a real machine (the `docs/user-guide` Gatekeeper / SmartScreen
   steps apply to unsigned builds). Publish the draft to release, or delete
   it to abort. Publishing creates the tag `v<version>` on the release
   commit — that click is the release decision the project brief reserves
   for the maintainer.
   A tag the maintainer pushes by hand takes the same path: the tag run
   builds everything and opens (or updates) the draft for that tag.
4. **The tag run.** Pushing the tag (which publishing does) re-runs the
   quality gates against the tag and, only if the repository variable
   `ROOMSCOPE_PUBLISH_PYPI` is `true` and the `pypi` environment and PyPI
   trusted publisher exist, uploads the wheel and sdist to PyPI. Until the
   maintainer sets that up, nothing reaches PyPI.

Rules that follow from this: the version in `pyproject.toml` is the single
source of truth (`roomscope.__version__` reads it from package metadata); a
tag whose name does not equal `v<pyproject version>` fails the workflow;
tags come only from publishing a draft or from the maintainer's own push;
published history is never rewritten.

### 3a. Without GitHub Actions minutes

A private repository spends its own Actions minutes, and macOS runners count
ten times. When they run out, jobs fail within seconds without a runner (no
step runs, no log). Three ways on, from cheapest:

1. **Build locally.** `scripts/build_release.py` runs the release workflow's
   bundle job on the machine it is started on and writes the same file names
   to `dist/`. Run it once per platform: on a Mac with Apple silicon
   (`RoomScope-macos-arm64.dmg`), an Intel Mac if available
   (`RoomScope-macos-x86_64.dmg`), Windows with Inno Setup 6 installed
   (`roomscope-windows-x64.zip`, `RoomScope-setup.exe`) and Linux x86_64
   (`roomscope-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`); add `--python-dist` on one of them for
   the wheel and sdist. The script installs nothing itself: install
   `requirements/bundle.lock`, the `dev` and `gui` extras, `pyinstaller==6.22.3`
   and `build` as the script's docstring shows; it refuses other versions
   unless `--allow-unlocked`. It runs the test suite, the license bundle, the
   `--strip --require-licenses` gate and the smoke test (CLI, fake-backend
   measurement, offscreen GUI, windowed launcher); on macOS it also ad-hoc
   signs the app and mounts, copies and launches it from the DMG. On
   Windows it compiles the installer but does not install, smoke-test and
   uninstall it as the workflow does (that would change the PC); do those
   three steps by hand before publishing a locally built installer.
2. **Publish by hand.** Create or edit the draft `v<version>` on the Releases
   page (tag `v<version>` on the release commit of `main`, *pre-release*),
   paste the notes (`packaging/release-notes-header.md` with `{version}`
   replaced, then the CHANGELOG section), upload every file from step 1 and
   each machine's `SHA256SUMS-*`, and publish. The PyPI job needs Actions;
   without it nothing reaches PyPI, as before.
3. **Make the repository public** (§5): standard GitHub-hosted runners are
   free for public repositories, and the workflow then runs as written.
   Done on 2026-09-24; the workflows have run on GitHub's runners since.

A locally built release has had exactly the checks the script ran on that
machine; `docs/STATUS.md` records which machines built which files.

### 3b. macOS signing: today, and with a Developer ID

**Today** the app is signed ad hoc, which only seals the bundle: it is not a
Developer ID signature, it is not notarized, and Gatekeeper blocks it on first
open (the user guide gives the steps). `packaging/macos/sign_app.sh` signs from
the inside out, as Apple asks for distributed code [A1][A2]: every loose
Mach-O file under `Contents/Frameworks`, each nested `.framework` deepest
first, then the app; `codesign --deep` is used only to verify, because Apple
advises against it for signing [A1][A3]. The released app has no hardened
runtime and no entitlements.

**Rehearsed in CI.** On both macOS runners (arm64, x86_64) the release job signs
a copy of the app with `sign_app.sh --runtime`: hardened runtime and
`entitlements-adhoc.plist`. That copy must start (GUI smoke, fake measurement)
and `roomscope doctor` must be able to create a cffi callback, the mechanism
PortAudio uses to call RoomScope from the audio thread. The entitlements, per
key:

| Key | Why | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` | Core Audio input (the microphone) under the hardened runtime; without it the system terminates the app | [A4][A5] |
| `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory` | python-sounddevice creates its stream callbacks with cffi's `ffi.callback` (ABI mode); cffi's documentation asks for this key on macOS, and Apple's x86_64 libffi maps writable-and-executable memory without `MAP_JIT` | [A6][A7] |
| `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` (rehearsal file only) | An ad hoc signature has no Team ID, so library validation would refuse the app's own libraries. A Developer ID build signs everything with one Team ID and does not need it | [A8] |

`entitlements.plist` (the Developer ID file) has the first two keys and never
`get-task-allow`, which notarization rejects [A9].

**With a Developer ID Application certificate** (maintainer decision, §5), the
steps are, in order, and none has been run yet:

1. Import the certificate into a temporary keychain on the runner from
   repository secrets (not written yet; nothing in the workflow reads a
   signing secret today, so community builds never need one).
2. `sh packaging/macos/sign_app.sh dist/RoomScope.app --identity "Developer ID Application: NAME (TEAMID)"`:
   the same order, plus `--timestamp` on every item and `--options runtime`
   with `entitlements.plist` on the app [A2][A9].
3. Build the DMG (`make_dmg.sh`), sign it with the same identity and
   `--timestamp` [A10].
4. `xcrun notarytool submit RoomScope-macos-<arch>.dmg --wait` with an App
   Store Connect API key (`--key`, `--key-id`, `--issuer`) or Apple ID,
   team ID and app-specific password; read `notarytool log` even on success
   [A11][A12].
5. `xcrun stapler staple` the DMG, then check with
   `spctl -a -t open -vvv --context context:primary-signature` on the DMG and
   `spctl -a -t exec -vvv` on the mounted app [A12][A13].
6. Compute the SHA-256 sums after stapling (stapling changes the DMG).

What CI cannot show without the certificate: a Developer ID signature,
library validation with a shared Team ID, secure timestamps, notarization,
stapling, Gatekeeper acceptance, and the microphone permission prompt.

Windows: the installer and executables are not Authenticode-signed; SmartScreen
warns on first run (user guide). This is a known limitation of the 0.x
pre-releases, not an error; signing is the same §5 decision.

## 4. Gates that apply to every release

* CI (`ci.yml`) green on the release commit: lint, mypy, docs link check,
  docs site build, `check_src_safety.py`, schema job, the test matrix
  (Ubuntu 3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14, macOS 3.12, Windows 3.12), the 85 % coverage
  gate on `core` and `models`, the package job, the installed-Essentials
  GPL gate.
* Release workflow green: bundle gate with `--strip --require-licenses`,
  smoke test (`--version`, fake-backend measurement, offscreen GUI) on
  each OS.
* No `UNKNOWN / NEEDS REVIEW` item in `DEPENDENCIES.md` §6 that affects
  the binary being shipped; the license bundle lists `unresolved: none`.
* `docs/STATUS.md` states what was run and what was not. Nothing is
  marked PASS that was not run; hardware cells stay empty until a person
  fills them with a date and an interface name.
* `CHANGELOG.md` has the version's section; overclaims found in review
  are corrected in the same release (for 0.4.0: the zh-CN catalog covered
  three of seven profiles, see #14; closed in 0.4.1).

## 5. Maintainer decisions still open

| Decision | Needed by | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public flip of the repository (ARCHITECTURE_V1.md §9.1 checklist: description and topics, branch protection on `main`, CODEOWNERS present, private vulnerability reporting, labels, Discussions, pinned roadmap) | 1.0.0rc1 (recommended at the first candidate so it gets outside testing) | Repository public since 2026-09-24; CODEOWNERS is present; the other checklist items are repository settings not checked here (the issue templates use the labels `hardware-report` and `daw-report`, which GitHub adds only if they exist) |
| Apple Developer ID + notarization, Windows Authenticode; or ship 1.0 unsigned with documentation | 1.0.0rc1 | Open; 0.x bundles are unsigned by design |
| PyPI: register `roomscope`, configure trusted publishing, create the `pypi` environment with required reviewers, set `ROOMSCOPE_PUBLISH_PYPI=true` | First version the maintainer wants on PyPI (earliest 0.5.0) | Open; the workflow stays off until then |
| Validation campaign: rooms, reference instrument (REW as a comparison instrument only), who runs it | 1.0.0rc1 | Open; no hardware available near-term |
| DCO sign-off requirement | Public flip | Open |
| Dependabot PRs #3 / #4 (actions/checkout 4→7, actions/setup-python 5→7) | Any time | Merge when Dependabot has rebased them onto the SHA-pinned workflows and CI is green |

## 6. Review follow-ups (2026-09-24)

Opened while merging the milestone PRs; none blocks 0.4.0, several block
0.5.0 (see §2). All nine are fixed in 0.4.1 (CHANGELOG `[0.4.1]`); an issue
is closed when that pull request is merged.

| Issue | Area | Severity | 0.4.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #9 | `compare`: frequency-response delta interpolates the raw spectrum before smoothing | medium | smoothed on the native grid first |
| #10 | `analyze_impulse_response` / `analyze-ir` untested | medium | tested; a quadratic pass search and non-IR input fixed on the way |
| #11 | session loader follows absolute member paths | low (security) | members confined to the session folder |
| #12 | loopback FIR window advances the compensated response by ~5 ms | medium | FIR origin at its peak, linear division, settling net of noise over the valid record |
| #13 | PortAudio: progress inside the real-time callback; swallowed callback errors | medium | progress polled, errors fail the take, channels validated first |
| #14 | zh-CN catalog incomplete; safety warning untranslated; `.mo` not shipped | high for the i18n claim | all profiles, contexts, hashed `.mo` in the wheel |
| #15 | ISO 3382-2 Table 1: source unnamed; engineering class ignores microphone count | medium | Table 1 read from the standard, every row checked |
| #16 | `check_src_safety.py` gaps; coverage figure unrecorded | low | aliases / dynamic imports; 90.20 % recorded |
| #17 | bundle gate misses the virtual-keyboard QML plugins | must close before any bundle is published | QML matched by directory; any QML tree fails |

## 7. What this plan does not do

It does not make the repository public, create a numbered Release, change
the license, push a tag, rewrite history, or claim any hardware result.
Each of those is either a maintainer click or a person in a room.
